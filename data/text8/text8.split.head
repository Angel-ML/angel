anarchism originated as a term of abuse first used against early working class radicals including the diggers of the english revolution and the sans culottes of the french revolution whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society it has also been
taken up as a positive label by self defined anarchists the word anarchism is derived from the greek without archons ruler chief king anarchism as a political philosophy is the belief that rulers are unnecessary and should be abolished although there are differing interpretations of what this means anarchism also refers to
related social movements that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions particularly the state the word anarchy as most anarchists use it does not imply chaos nihilism or anomie but rather a harmonious anti authoritarian society in place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions anarchists advocate social relations based upon
voluntary association of autonomous individuals mutual aid and self governance while anarchism is most easily defined
by what it is against anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society however ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably especially with respect to economics there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about origins and predecessors kropotkin and others argue that before recorded
history human society was organized on anarchist principles most anthropologists follow kropotkin and engels in believing that hunter gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour accumulated wealth or decreed law
and had equal access to resources william godwin anarchists including the the anarchy organisation and rothbard find anarchist attitudes in taoism from ancient china kropotkin found similar ideas in stoic zeno of citium according to kropotkin zeno repudiated the omnipotence of the state its intervention and regimentation and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual the anabaptists of one six th century europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism bertrand russell in his history of western philosophy writes that the anabaptists repudiated all law since they held that the good man
will be guided at every moment by the holy spirit from this premise they arrive at communism the diggers or true levellers were an early communistic movement during the time of the english civil war and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism in the modern era the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was louis armand
baron de lahontan in his nouveaux voyages dans l am rique septentrionale one seven zero three where he described the indigenous american society which had no state laws prisons priests or private property as being in anarchy russell means a libertarian and leader in the american indian movement has repeatedly stated that he is an anarchist and so are all his ancestors in one seven nine three in the thick of the french revolution william godwin published an enquiry concerning political justice although godwin did not use the word anarchism many later anarchists have regarded this book as
the first major anarchist text and godwin as the founder of philosophical anarchism but at this point no anarchist movement yet existed and the term anarchiste was known mainly as an insult hurled by the bourgeois girondins at more radical elements in the french revolution the first self labelled anarchist pierre joseph proudhon it is commonly held that it wasn t until pierre joseph proudhon published what is property in one eight four zero that the term anarchist was adopted as a self description it is for this reason that some
claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed
the institution of decreed property propri t where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish such as exploiting workers for profit in its place proudhon supported what he called possession individuals can have limited rights to use resources capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice proudhon s vision of anarchy which he called mutualism mutuellisme involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade
the products of their labor using labor notes which represented the amount of working time involved in production this would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others workers could freely join together in co operative workshops an interest free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production proudhon s ideas
were influential within french working class movements and his followers were active in the revolution of one eight four eight in france proudhon s philosophy of property is complex it was developed in a number of works over
his lifetime and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas for more detailed discussion see here max stirner s egoism in his the ego and its own stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions including the notion of state property as a right natural rights in general and the very notion of society were mere illusions or ghosts in the mind saying of society that the individuals are
its reality he advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in associations of egoists only when it was in their self interest to do so for him property simply comes about through might whoever knows how to take to defend the thing to him belongs property and what i have in my power that is my own so long as i assert myself as
holder i am the proprietor of the thing stirner never called himself an anarchist he accepted only the label egoist nevertheless his ideas were influential on many individualistically inclined anarchists although interpretations of his thought are diverse american individualist anarchism benjamin tucker in one eight two five josiah warren had participated in a communitarian experiment headed by robert owen called new harmony which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict warren blamed the community s
failure on a lack of individual sovereignty and a lack of private property warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called the sovereignty of the individual at utopia and modern times in one eight three three warren wrote and published the peaceful revolutionist which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published benjamin tucker says that warren was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism liberty xiv december
one nine zero zero one benjamin tucker became interested in anarchism through
meeting josiah warren and william b greene he edited and published liberty from august one eight eight one to april one nine zero eight it is widely considered to be the finest individualist anarchist periodical ever issued in the english language tucker s conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists greene s ideas on mutual banking warren s ideas on cost as the limit of price a heterodox variety of labour theory of value proudhon s market anarchism max stirner s egoism and
herbert spencer s law of equal freedom tucker strongly supported the individual s right to own the product of his or her
labour as private property and believed in a market economy for trading this property he argued that in a truly free market system without the state the abundance of competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor other one nine th century individualists included lysander spooner stephen pearl andrews and victor
yarros the first international mikhail bakunin one eight one four one eight seven six in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight twenty years later in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united some diverse european revolutionary currents including anarchism due to its genuine links to active workers movements the international became signficiant from the start karl marx was a leading figure in the international he was elected to every succeeding general
council of the association the first objections to marx came from the mutualists who opposed communism and statism shortly after mikhail bakunin and his followers joined in one eight
six eight the first international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads the clearest difference between the camps was over strategy the
anarchists around bakunin favoured in kropotkin s words direct economical struggle against capitalism without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation at that time marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity bakunin characterised marx s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that if a marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought
against in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress this is often cited as the origin of the conflict between anarchists and marxists from this moment the social democratic and libertarian currents of socialism
had distinct organisations including rival internationals anarchist communism peter kropotkin proudhon and bakunin both opposed communism associating it with statism however in the one eight seven zero s many anarchists moved away from bakunin s economic thinking called collectivism and embraced communist concepts communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively and that goods be distributed by need not labor an early anarchist communist was joseph d jacque the first
person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature he announced his ideas in his us published journal le libertaire one eight five eight one
eight six one peter kropotkin often seen as the most important theorist outlined his economic ideas in the conquest of bread and fields factories and workshops he felt co operation is more beneficial than competition illustrated in nature in mutual aid a factor of evolution one eight nine seven subsequent anarchist
communists include emma goldman and alexander berkman many in the anarcho syndicalist movements see below saw anarchist communism as their objective isaac puente s one nine three two comunismo libertario was adopted by the spanish cnt as its manifesto for a post revolutionary
society some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty for example benjamin tucker whilst professing respect for kropotkin and publishing his work described communist anarchism as pseudo anarchism propaganda of the deed johann most was an outspoken advocate of violence anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous
and violent due mainly to a number of high profile violent acts including riots assassinations insurrections and terrorism by some anarchists some revolutionaries of the late one nine th century encouraged acts of political violence such as bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism such actions have sometimes
been called propaganda by the deed one of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was johann most who said the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in
motion most s preferred method of terrorism dynamite earned him the moniker dynamost however there is no consensus on the
legitimacy or utility of violence in general mikhail bakunin and errico malatesta for example wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings but at the same time they denounced acts of individual terrorism malatesta in on violence and bakunin when he refuted nechaev other anarchists sometimes identified as pacifist anarchists advocated complete nonviolence leo tolstoy whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of christian anarchism see below was a notable exponent
of nonviolent resistance anarchism in the labour movement the red and black flag coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement is particularly associated with anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalism was an early two zero th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society the movement pursued industrial actions such as general strike as a primary strategy many anarcho syndicalists believed in anarchist communism though not all communists believed in syndicalism after the one eight seven one repression french anarchism reemerged influencing the bourses
de travails of autonomous workers groups and trade unions from this movement the conf d ration g n rale du travail general confederation of work cgt
was formed in one eight nine five as the first major anarcho syndicalist movement emile pataud and emile pouget s writing for the cgt saw libertarian communism developing from a general strike after one nine one four the cgt moved
away from anarcho syndicalism due to the appeal of bolshevism french style syndicalism was a significant movement in europe prior to one nine two one and remained a significant movement in spain until the mid one nine four zero s the industrial workers of the

latin american anarchism was strongly influenced extending to the zapatista rebellion and the factory occupation movements in argentina in berlin in one nine two two the cnt was joined with the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the first international contemporary anarcho syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities much smaller than in the one nine one zero s two zero s and three zero s the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in

as work and the workplace anarcho syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity direct action and self management the russian revolution the russian revolution of one nine one seven was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy anarchists
participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions many anarchists initially supporting the bolshevik coup however the bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left wing opposition a conflict which culminated in the one nine one eight kronstadt rebellion anarchists in central russia were imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks in ukraine anarchists fought in the civil war against both whites and bolsheviks within the makhnovshchina peasant
army led by nestor makhno expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman before leaving russia were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in russia aiming to expose the reality of bolshevik control for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule had proved all too true the victory of
the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of
anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the us for example the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the communist international in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new
forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their one nine two six manifesto known as the organisational platform of the libertarian communists was supported by some communist anarchists though opposed by many others the platform continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of theoretical unity tactical unity collective responsibility and federalism platformist groups today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland the uk s anarchist federation and the late north eastern federation of anarchist communists in the northeastern united states and bordering canada the
fight against fascism spain one nine three six members of the cnt construct armoured cars to fight against the fascists in one of the collectivised factories in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s the familiar dynamics of anarchism s conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of fascism in europe in many cases european anarchists faced difficult choices should they join in popular fronts with reformist democrats and soviet led communists against a common fascist enemy luigi fabbri an
exile from italian fascism was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different fascism is not just another form of government which like all others uses violence it is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable it represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority in france where the fascists came close to insurrection in the february one nine three four riots anarchists divided over a united front policy in spain the
cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a
right wing election victory but in one nine three six the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later the ruling class responded with an attempted coup and the spanish civil war one nine
three six three nine was underway in reponse to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of
the major city of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivized the land but even before the eventual fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists the cnt leadership often appeared confused and divided with some members controversially entering the
government stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists have been
involved in fighting the rise of neo fascist groups in germany and the united kingdom some anarchists worked within militant anti fascist groups alongside members of the marxist left they advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state since the late one nine nine zero s a similar tendency has developed within us anarchism see also anti racist action us anti fascist action uk antifa religious anarchism leo tolstoy one eight two eight one
nine one zero most anarchist culture tends to be secular if not outright anti religious however the combination of religious social conscience historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism christian anarchists believe that there is no higher authority than god and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches they believe that jesus teachings were clearly anarchistic
but were corrupted when christianity was declared the official religion of rome christian anarchists who follow jesus directive to turn the other cheek are strict pacifists the most famous advocate of christian anarchism was leo tolstoy author of the kingdom of god is within you who called for a society based on compassion nonviolent principles and freedom christian anarchists tend to form experimental communities they also occasionally resist taxation many christian anarchists are vegetarian or vegan christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion s birth as the early church exhibits many anarchistic tendencies
such as communal goods and wealth by aiming to obey utterly certain of the bible s teachings certain anabaptist groups of sixteenth century europe attempted to emulate the early church s social economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only
social structure capable of true obediance to jesus teachings and utterly rejected in theory all earthly hierarchies and authority and indeed non anabaptists in general and violence as
ungodly such groups for example the hutterites typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to as their movements stabalised more authoritarian social models chinese anarchism was most influential in the one nine two zero s strands of chinese anarchism included tai xu s buddhist anarchism which was influenced by tolstoy and the well field
system neopaganism with its focus on the environment and equality along with its often decentralized nature has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists one of the most prominent is starhawk who writes extensively about both spirituality
and activism anarchism and feminism emma goldman early french feminists such as jenny d h ricourt and juliette adam criticised the mysogyny in
the anarchism of proudhon during the one eight five zero s anarcha feminism is a kind of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society while anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years its explicit formulation as anarcha feminism dates back to the early seven zero s during the second wave feminist movement anarcha feminism views patriarchy as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history thus the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female anarcha feminists then conclude that if feminists are against
patriarchy they must also be against all forms of hierarchy and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism anarcho primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of civilization and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns eco feminism is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought
anarcha feminism is most often associated with early two zero th century authors and theorists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre although even early first wave feminist mary wollstonecraft held proto anarchist views and william godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor it should be noted that goldman and de cleyre though they both opposed the state had opposing philosophies as de cleyre explains miss goldman is a communist i am an individualist she wishes to destroy the right of property
i wish to assert it i make my war upon privilege and authority whereby the right of property the true right in that which is proper
to the individual is annihilated she believes that co operation would entirely supplant competition i hold that competition in one form or another will always exist and that it is highly desirable it should in the spanish civil war an anarcha feminist group free women organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas in the modern day anarchist movement many anarchists male or female consider themselves feminists and anarcha feminist ideas are growing the publishing of quiet rumors an anarcha feminist reader has
helped to spread various kinds of anti authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader
movement wendy mcelroy has popularized an individualist anarchism take on feminism in her books articles and individualist feminist website anarcho capitalism murray rothbard one nine two six one nine nine
five anarcho capitalism is a predominantly united states based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of free market capitalism unlike other branches of anarchism it does not oppose profit or capitalism consequently
most anarchists do not recognise anarcho capitalism as a form of anarchism murray rothbard s synthesis
of classical liberalism and austrian economics was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho capitalist theory he defines anarcho capitalism in terms of the non aggression principle based on the concept of natural law competiting theorists use egoism utilitarianism used by david friedman or contractarianism used
by jan narveson some minarchists such as ayn rand robert nozick and robert a heinlein have influenced anarcho capitalism some anarcho capitalists along with
some right wing libertarian historians such as david hart and ralph raico considered similar philosophies existing prior to rothbard to be
anarcho capitalist such as those of gustave de molinari and auberon herbert opponents of anarcho capitalists dispute these claims the place of anarcho capitalism within anarchism and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all is highly controversial for more on this debate see anarchism and anarcho capitalism anarchism and the environment since the late one nine seven zero s
anarchists in anglophone and european countries have been taking action for the natural environment eco anarchists or green anarchists believe in deep ecology this is a worldview that embraces biodiversity and sustainability eco anarchists often use direct action against what
they see as earth destroying institutions of particular importance is the earth first movement that takes action such as tree sitting another important component is ecofeminism which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women green anarchism also involves a critique of
industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists civilization itself primitivism is a predominantly western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre industrial and usually pre agricultural society it develops a critique of industrial civilization in this critique technology and development have alienated people from the natural world this philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the luddites and the writings of jean jacques rousseau primitivism developed in the context of the reclaim the streets earth first and the earth liberation front movements john
zerzan wrote that civilization not just the state would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved
anarcho primitivists point to the anti authoritarian nature of many primitive or hunter gatherer societies throughout the world s history as examples of anarchist societies
other branches and offshoots anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements since the western social formet in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s a number new of movements and schools have appeared most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above hakim bey post left anarchy post left anarchy

originated by saul newman first receiving popular attention in his book from bakunin to lacan to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis
of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought subsequent to newman s use of the term however it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including autonomism post left anarchy situationism post colonialism and zapatismo by its very nature post anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs

political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify

economic coercion on a global scale carried out through state institutions such as the world bank world trade organization group of eight and the world economic forum globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions most anarchists use the term to
mean neocolonialism and or cultural imperialism which they may see as related many are active in the anti globalization movement others particularly anarcho capitalists use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene parallel structures many anarchists try
to set up alternatives to state supported institutions and outposts such as food not bombs infoshops educational systems such as home schooling neighborhood mediation arbitration groups and so on the idea is to create the structures for a new anti authoritarian society in the shell of the old authoritarian one technology recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people many people use the internet to form on line communities intellectual property is undermined and a gift

anarchists consider pacifism opposition to war to be inherent in their philosophy anarcho pacifists take it further and follow leo tolstoy s belief in non violence anarchists see war as an activity
in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power both domestically and in foreign lands and subscribe to randolph bourne s view that war is the health of the state a lot of anarchist activity has been anti war based parliamentarianism in general terms the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections because voting amounts to condoning the state voluntaryism is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes tending your own garden and neither ballots nor bullets the anarchist case against voting is explained in the ethics of voting

most anarchist schools of thought are to some degree sectarian there is often a difference of opinion within each school about how to react to or interact with other schools some such as panarchists believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction others see opportunities for coalition building or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes see anarchism without adjectives criticisms of anarchism
main article criticisms of anarchism violence since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction some people have seen it as being too violent on the other hand hand frederick engels criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough a revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon
the other part by means of rifles bayonets and cannon authoritarian means if such there be at all and if the victorious party does not want
to have fought in vain it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its
arms inspire in the reactionists would the paris commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois utopianism anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible or plain
utopian even by many who agree that it s a nice idea in principle for example carl landauer in his book european socialism criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian and holds that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he holds that the belief that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however it must be noted that
not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism for example some such as benjamin tucker advocate privately funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property however other anarchists such as sir herbert read proudly accept the characterization utopian class character marxists have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the petite bourgeoisie or perhaps the lumpenproletariat see e g plekhanov for a marxist critique of one eight nine five anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt middle class dilettantes most recently in relation to
anti capitalist protesters tacit authoritarianism in recent decades anarchism has been criticised by
situationists post anarchists and others of preserving tacitly statist authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade hypocrisy some critics point to the sexist and racist views of some prominent anarchists notably proudhon and bakunin as examples of hypocrisy inherent within anarchism while many anarchists however dismiss that the personal prejudices of one nine th century theorists influence the beliefs of present day anarchists others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be eurocentric and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like proudhon on fascism
through groups like cercle proudhon anarcho capitalist bryan caplan argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by spanish anarchists in the spanish civil war was a form of illegitimate coercion making the proffessed anarchists ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians alongside the communists and fascists he also criticizes the willingness of the cnt to join the
statist republican government during the civil war and references stanley g
payne s book on the franco regime which claims that the cnt entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war cultural phenomena noam chomsky one nine two eight the kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently litist the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self avowed anarchists the mit professor of linguistics noam chomsky the science fiction author ursula k le guin the social historian howard
zinn entertainer and author hans alfredsson the avant garde artist nicol s rossell in denmark the freetown christiania was created in downtown copenhagen the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like the one still thriving in barcelona in catalonia militant resistance to neo nazi groups in places like germany and the uprisings of autonomous marxism situationist and autonomist groups in france and italy also helped to give popularity to anti authoritarian non capitalist ideas in various musical styles anarchism rose in popularity most famous for the
linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock although in the modern age hip hop and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message in the uk this was associated with the punk rock movement the band crass

dedicated pages at the daily bleed s anarchist encyclopedia infoshop org wikipedia page industrial workers of the world anarchism forms of government political ideology entry points political theories social philosophy autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction communication ability patterns of interests and patterns of behavior although the specific etiology of autism is unknown many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers and while there is disagreement about the magnitude nature and mechanisms for such environmental factors researchers have found at least seven major
genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one united states child in one six six however the national institute of mental health gives a more conservative estimate of one in one zero zero zero for families that already have one autistic child the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty diagnosis
is based on a list of psychiatric criteria and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used autism may not be physiologically obvious a complete physical and neurological evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways by definition autism must manifest
delays in social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play with onset prior to age three years according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the icd one zero also says that symptoms must manifest before the age of three years there have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism for
reasons that are heavily debated by researchers in psychology and related fields within the scientific community some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology however many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate at least in
writing are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions and see such conditions as part of who they are history dr hans asperger described a form of autism in the one nine four zero s that later became known
as asperger s syndrome the word autism was first used in the english language by swiss psychiatrist eugene bleuler in a one nine one two number of the american journal of insanity it comes from the greek word for self however the classification of autism did not occur until the middle of the twentieth century when in one nine four
three psychiatrist dr leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital in baltimore reported on one one child patients with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label early infantile autism he suggested autism from the greek autos meaning self to describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people although kanner s first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal the nervous child
almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders at the same time an austrian scientist dr hans asperger described a different form of autism that became known as asperger s syndrome but the widespread recognition of asperger s work was delayed by world war ii in germany and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn t translated into english for almost five zero years the majority of his work wasn t
widely read until one nine nine seven thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr fourth edition text revision one as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders asd all of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in communication
skills social interactions and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior few clinicians today solely use the dsm iv criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones many clinicians instead use an alternate means or a combination thereof to more accurately determine a diagnosis terminology when referring to someone diagnosed with
autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used instead this is referred to as person first terminology the autistic community generally prefers the term autistic for reasons that are fairly controversial this article uses the term autistic see talk page characteristics dr leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three there is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis much of this is due to
the sensory system of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non autistic and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another nevertheless professionals within pediatric care and development often look
for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible however some people do not believe in treatment for autism either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good social development typically developing infants are social beings early in life they do such things as gaze at people turn toward voices grasp a finger and even smile in contrast most autistic children prefer objects to faces and
seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give and take of everyday human interaction even in the first few months of life many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non autistic children children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling
without reciprocating or resist attention altogether later they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents displays of anger or affection in a typical way research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling teaching
and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected attachment behavior children with autism appear to lack theory of mind the ability to see things from another person s perspective a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and possibly other higher primates such as adult gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos typical five year olds can develop insights
into other people s different knowledge feelings and intentions interpretations based upon social cues e g gestures facial expressions an individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people s actions the social alienation of
autistic and asperger s people is so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship however having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non autistic children although not universal it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior this can take the form of
crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments they may react negatively to changes in them it is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression increased levels of self stimulatory behavior self injury or
extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations sensory system a key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration dysfunction children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch movement sights or sounds
physical clumsiness or carelessness poor body awareness a tendency to be easily distracted impulsive physical or verbal behavior an activity level
that is unusually high or low not unwinding or calming oneself difficulty
learning new movements difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another social and or emotional problems delays in speech language or motor skills specific learning difficulties delays in academic achievement one common example is an individual with autism hearing a person with autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain
situations such as in a large crowd of people see cocktail party
effect however this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person so these examples may not apply to every autistic it should be noted that sensory difficulties although reportedly common in autistics are not part of the dsm iv diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder communication difficulties by age three typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones one of the earliest is babbling by the first birthday a typical toddler says words turns when he or she hears his or her
name points when he or she wants a toy and when offered something distasteful makes it clear that the answer is no speech development in people with autism takes different paths some
remain mute throughout their lives while being fully literate and able to communicate in other ways images sign language and typing are far more natural to them some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life but stop soon afterwards others may be
delayed developing language as late as the teenage years still inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware once given appropriate accommodations many will happily converse for hours and can often be found in online chat rooms discussion boards or websites and even using communication devices at autism community social events such as autreat those who do speak often use language in unusual ways retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods
or throughout their lives some speak only single words while others repeat the same phrase over and over some repeat what they hear a condition called echolalia sing song repetitions in particular are a calming joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in many people with autism have a strong tonal sense and can often understand
spoken language some children may exhibit only slight delays in language or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies but have great difficulty in sustaining typical conversations the give and take of non autistic conversation is hard for them although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject giving no one else an opportunity to comment when given the chance to converse with other autistics they comfortably do so in parallel monologue taking turns expressing views and information just as neurotypicals people without autism have trouble
understanding autistic body languages vocal tones or phraseology people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism in particular autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words the body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand facial expressions movements and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism but do
not match those used by other people also their tone of voice has a
much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings and the auditory system of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations what seems to non autistic people like a high pitched sing song or flat robot like voice is common in autistic children some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults rather than communicating at their current age level which is one of the things that can lead to problems since
non autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic body language and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need as anybody might do in such a situation they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want while waiting for non autistic people to learn to communicate with them people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them communication difficulties may contribute to
autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed repetitive behaviors although
people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control unusual repetitive motions known as self stimulation or stimming may set them apart these behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes others suddenly freeze in position as children they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a
certain way not using them for pretend play if someone accidentally moves one of these toys the child may be tremendously upset autistic children often need and demand absolute
consistency in their environment a slight change in any routine in mealtimes dressing taking a bath or going to school at a certain time and by the same route can be extremely disturbing people with autism sometimes have a persistent intense preoccupation for example the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners train schedules or lighthouses often they show great interest in different languages numbers symbols or science topics repetitive
behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well perseveration of a single word or phrase even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child s daily routine effects in education children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day these unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student because they have trouble understanding people s thoughts and feelings they have
trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them they do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what
emotion their instructor is displaying this inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful teachers need to be aware of a student s disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught some students learn better with visual aids as they are better
able to understand material presented this way because of this many teachers create visual schedules for their autistic students this allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication but with socialization as well they
feel self conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts by allowing them to work with peers they can make friends which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise by doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom a teacher s aide can also be useful to the student the aide is able to give
more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child the aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class this allows a partially one on one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in
a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need there are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students a teacher needs to become familiar with the child s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them students with autism spectrum disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress particularly in social environments like school if a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior it is important for educational
teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety preparing students for new situations by writing social stories can lower anxiety teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching
approaches such as the incredible five point scale or other cognitive behavioral strategies can increase a student s ability to control excessive behavioral reactions dsm definition autism is defined in section two nine nine zero zero of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv as a total of six or more items from one two and three with at least two from one and one each from two and three qualitative impairment in social interaction as manifested by at least two of the following marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such
as eye to eye gaze facial expression body postures and gestures to regulate social interaction failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment interests or achievements with other people e g by a lack of showing bringing or pointing out objects of interest lack
of social or emotional reciprocity qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following delay in or total lack of the development of spoken language not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime in individuals with adequate speech marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language lack of varied spontaneous make believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior interests and
activities as manifested by at least one of the following encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus apparently inflexible adherence to specific nonfunctional routines or rituals stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms e g hand or finger
flapping or twisting or complex whole body movements persistent preoccupation with parts of objects delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three symbolic or imaginative play the disturbance is not better accounted for by rett s disorder or childhood
disintegrative disorder the diagnostic and statistical manual s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective see the dsm cautionary statement the criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis types of autism autism presents in a wide degree from those who are
nearly dysfunctional and apparently mentally handicapped to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional normal to the general public in terms of both classification and therapy autistic individuals are often
divided into those with an iq eight zero are referred to as having high functioning autism hfa low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living rather than to iq the terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels further these two labels are not currently used or accepted in autism literature this discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate iq with functioning and may refuse to serve high iq autistic people who
are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered lfa for example some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible as a consequence many
high functioning autistic persons and autistic people with a relatively high iq are underdiagnosed thus making the claim that autism implies retardation self fulfilling the number of people diagnosed with lfa is not rising quite as sharply as hfa indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics asperger s and kanner s syndrome asperger described his patients as little professors in the current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
disorders dsm iv tr the most significant difference between autistic disorder kanner s and asperger s syndrome is that a
diagnosis of the former includes the observation of delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three symbolic or imaginative play while a diagnosis of asperger s syndrome observes no clinically significant delay in these areas the dsm makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning but the fact that asperger s autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with kanner s autism has produced a popular
conception that asperger s syndrome is synonymous with higher functioning autism or that it is a lesser disorder than autism there is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have asperger s autism or that
both types are merely geeks with a medical label attached also autism has evolved in the public understanding but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in rain man has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having asperger s syndrome rather than autism autism as
a spectrum disorder another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as autistic spectrum disorders a related continuum is sensory integration dysfunction which
is about how well we integrate the information we receive from
our senses autism asperger s syndrome and sensory integration dysfunction are all closely related and overlap there are two main manifestations of classical autism regressive
autism and early infantile autism early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of three and often around one eight months although this causes some controversy over
when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder this triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother s body and is transfered to the fetus the triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child s body increase in diagnoses of autism the number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the
past decade statistics in graph from the national center for health statistics there has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder in the twentieth century this has
brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the united states is partly or entirely attributable to
changes in diagnostic criteria reclassifications public awareness and the incentive to receive federally mandated services a widely cited study from the m i n d institute in california one seven october two zero zero two claimed that the increase in autism is real even after those complicating factors are
accounted for see reference in this section below other researchers remain unconvinced see references below including dr chris johnson a professor of pediatrics at the university of texas health sciences center at san antonio and cochair of the american academy of pediatrics autism expert panel who says there is a chance we re seeing a true rise but right now i don t think anybody can answer that question for sure newsweek reference below the answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research since a real
increase would focus more attention and research funding on the search for environmental factors while little or no real increase would focus more attention to genetics on the other hand it is conceivable that certain environmental factors vaccination diet societal changes may have a particular impact on people
with a specific genetic constitution there is little public research on the effects of in vitro fertilization on the number of incidences of autism one of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between geekdom and autism this is hinted for instance by a wired magazine article in two zero zero one entitled the geek syndrome which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement this article many professionals assert is just one example of
the media s application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior they argue that shyness lack of athletic ability or social skills and intellectual interests even when they seem unusual to others are not in themselves signs of autism or asperger s syndrome others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the
past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled gifted see clinomorphism for further discussion of this issue due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders an increasing number of adults are choosing to
seek diagnoses of high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood since the cause of autism
is thought to be at least partly genetic a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow up to their children s diagnoses because autism falls into the pervasive developmental disorder category strictly speaking symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a differential diagnosis therapies sociology due to the complexity of autism there are many facets of sociology that need to be considered when discussing it such as the culture
which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another in addition there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community sometimes in strong opposition to one another community and politics much like many other controversies in the world the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups essentially these groups are those who seek a cure for autism dubbed pro cure those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it dubbed
anti cure and the many people caught in the middle
of the two in recent history with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure some members of the anti cure movement sent a
letter to the united nations demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a mental disability or disease websites such as autistics org present the view of the anti cure group there are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person many of these resources are available online in addition sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community
will help out children with autism much in the way a master would help out an apprentice for example two zero zero two was declared autism awareness year in the united kingdom this idea was initiated
by ivan and charika corea parents of an autistic child charin autism awareness year was led by the british institute of brain injured children disabilities trust national autistic society autism london and eight zero zero organizations in the united kingdom it had the personal backing of british prime
minister tony blair and parliamentarians of all parties in the palace of westminster culture with the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics an autistic culture has begun to develop similar to deaf culture autistic culture is based in a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured there are some commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture not just autistic culture it is a common misperception that
people with autism do not marry many do get married often they marry another person with autism although this is not always the case many times autistics are attracted to other autistics due to shared interests or obsessions but more often than not the attraction is due to simple compatibility with personality types the same as is true for non autistics autistics who communicate have explained that companionship is as important to autistics as it is to anyone else multigenerational autistic families
have also recently become a bit more common the interests of autistic people and so called geeks or nerds can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects much like the variant normal behavior geeks experience however in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in groups which impairs them even in the most technical of situations autistic adults temple grandin one of the more
successful adults with autism photograph courtesy joshua nathaniel pritikin and william lawrence jarrold some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs usually those with high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome nevertheless communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of the autistic s life other autistics are capable of employment in sheltered
workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities a nurturing environment at home at school and later in job training and at work helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to communicate and form online communities in addition to being able
to find occupations such as independent consulting which does generally not require much human interaction offline in the united states the public schools responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is in their two zero s depending on each state the family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals autistic savants the autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people the term is used to describe a
person who is autistic and has extreme talent in a certain area of study although there is a common association between savants and autism an association created by the one nine
eight eight film rain man most autistic people are not savants mental calculators and fast programming skills are the most common form the famous example is daniel tammet the subject of the documentary film the brain man kim peek one of the inspirations for dustin hoffman s character in the film rain man is not autistic bright splinters of the mind is a book that explores this issue further other pervasive developmental disorders autism and asperger s syndrome
are just two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdds the three other pervasive developmental disorders are rett syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified some of these are related to autism while some of them are entirely separate conditions rett syndrome rett syndrome is relatively rare affecting almost exclusively females one out of one zero zero zero zero to one five zero zero zero after a period of normal development sometime between six and one eight months autism like symptoms begin
to appear the little girl s mental and social development regresses she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact if she has been talking she stops she cannot control her feet she wrings her hands some of
these early symptoms may be confused for autism some of the problems associated with rett syndrome can be treated physical occupational and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination movement and speech scientists sponsored by the national institute of child health and human development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene causes rett syndrome and can physically test for it with a eight zero accuracy rate rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder however most scientists agree that rett syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and
not part of the autistic spectrum childhood disintegrative disorder childhood disintegrative disorder cdd and sometimes abbreviated as chdd
also is a condition appearing in three or four year old children who
have developed normally until age two over several months the child will deteriorate in intellectual social and language functioning from previously normal behaviour this long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate cdd from rett syndrome and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing the cause for cdd is unknown thus it may be a spectrum disorder but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified or pdd nos is referred to as a subthreshold condition because it
is a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction communication and or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders pdd nos has no specific guidelines for diagnosis so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person or few to none at all note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions while pdd nos is an official diagnosis

of reflectivity of a surface or body it is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation em radiation reflected to the amount
incident upon it the fraction usually expressed as a percentage from zero to one zero zero is an important concept in climatology and astronomy this ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered unqualified it refers to an average across the spectrum of visible light it also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation unqualified normal incidence fresh snow albedos are high up to nine zero the ocean surface has a low albedo the average albedo of earth is about three zero whereas the
albedo of the moon is about seven in astronomy the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition most notably ice content enceladus a moon of saturn has the highest known albedo of any body in
the solar system with nine nine of em radiation reflected human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the
globe however quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease global warming the classical example of albedo effect is the snow temperature feedback
if a snow covered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and
the temperature tends to increase the converse is true if snow forms a
cooling cycle happens the intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very
large in the tropics some examples of albedo effects fairbanks alaska according to the national climatic data center s ghcn two data which is composed of three zero year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world the college weather station at fairbanks alaska is about three c five f warmer than the airport at fairbanks partly
because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space neunke and kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late winter months when solar radiation is greater the tropics
although the albedo temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of earth because more snow falls there it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently
more sunlight when brazilian ranchers cut down dark tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil
in order to grow crops the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about three c five f year round which is a significant amount small scale effects albedo works on
a smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than those who wear white clothes pine forests the albedo of a pine forest at four five n in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about nine among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment this is partly due to the color of the pines and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level due to light
penetration the ocean s albedo is even lower at about three five though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation dense swampland averages between nine and one four deciduous trees average about one three a grassy field usually comes in at about two zero a barren field will depend on the color of the soil and can be as low as
five or as high as four zero with one five being about the average for farmland a desert or large beach usually averages around two five but varies depending on the color of the sand reference edward walker s study in the great plains in the winter around four five n urban areas
urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface in the northern part of the world cities are relatively dark and walker has shown that their average albedo is about seven with only a slight increase during the summer in most
tropical countries cities average around one two this is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions e g there are more very dark trees around another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor and city buildings must be built with different materials warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building
materials so the structures will remain cooler trees because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are one zero to five zero higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon
sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming snow snow albedos can be as high
as nine zero this is for the ideal example however fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape over antarctica they average a little more than eight zero if a marginally snow covered area
warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo feedback this is the

or as history the letter a probably started as a pictogram of an ox head in egyptian hieroglyphs or the proto semitic alphabet by one six zero zero bc the phoenician alphabet s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for all later forms its name must have corresponded closely to the hebrew aleph the name is also similar to the arabic alif when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for the glottal stop that the letter had denoted
in phoenician and other semitic languages so they used the sign for the vowel and changed its name to alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions dating to the eight th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to what was italy and left
the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write latin and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern latin alphabet used to write many languages including english the letter has two minuscule lower case forms the form used in
most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version below many fonts then made the

the very first two lines of the iliad read transliterated
m nin aeide thea p l iade akhil os oulomen n h muri akhaiois alge eth ken translated sing muse the wrath of achilles the son of peleus the destructive wrath that brought countless griefs upon the achaeans statue of achillesin these lines we see the name akhilleus peleides which is a praenomen and a patronymic the latter being formed from peleus with the suffix ides producing achilles the son of peleus the system is similar to
the names used by scandinavians before modern times such as leif erikson achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos grief and
laos a people tribe nation etc in other words achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the iliad frequently by achilles achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of kleos glory usually glory in war laos has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers with this derivation the name would
have a double meaning in the poem when the hero is
functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership birth achilles was the son of the mortal peleus king of the myrmidons in phthia southeast thessaly and the sea nymph thetis zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fire bringer prophesized that thetis would bear a son greater than
his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed to peleus when achilles was born according to the most common version of the myth thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in
the river styx but she forgot to wet the heel she
held him by leaving him vulnerable at that spot see achilles tendon in an earlier and less popular version of
the story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage homer does not make reference to this invulnerability in the iliad to the contrary he mentions achilles being wounded although not seriously peleus gave him together with his young friend or lover patroclus to
chiron the centaur on mt pelion to be raised achilles in the trojan war telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge
alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed this is an example of sympathetic magic during the trojan war the rage of achilles by giovanni battista tiepolo in homer s iliad achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage menon his anger is at some
times wavering at other times absolute the humanization of achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the iliad achilles charioteer s name was automedon troilus according to
dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy while troilus the youngest son of priam and hecuba whom some say was fathered by apollo was watering his horses at the lion fountain outside the walls of troy achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty whose loveliness of form was described by ibycus as being like gold thrice refined the youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of apollo achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god
s own altar tzetzes scholiast on lycophron at the time troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday and the legend goes that if troilus had lived to be twenty troy would have been invincible first vatican mythographer agamemnon and the death of patroclus patroclus and achilles achilles bandages the arm of his friend patroclus the latter turns his head aside to avoid the sight of blood and of achilles noticing his pain grimaces the scene has been interpreted as an act of
welfare and comradeship or as a scene with sexual overtones ancient greek culture often held the two to be lovers
achilles took two three towns outside troy including lyrnessos where he captured briseis to keep as a concubine meanwhile agamemnon took a woman named chryseis and taunted her father chryses a priest of apollo when he attempted to buy her back apollo sent a plague through the greek
armies and agamemnon was forced to give chryseis back to her
father however he took briseis away from achilles as compensation for his loss this action sparked the central plot of the iliad achilles becomes enraged and refuses to fight for the greeks any further the war goes badly through the influence of zeus and the greeks offer handsome reparations to their greatest warrior after
the greeks are pushed back to the ships which are just starting to be set on fire by the trojan hero hector achilles is visited by odysseus ajax and phoenix who attempt to persuade him to
return to battle achilles still refuses to fight but agrees to allow patroclus to fight in his place wearing his armor the next day patroclus is killed and stripped of the armor by hector who mistakes him for achilles achilles is overwhelmed with grief for his beloved friend and the rage he once harbored toward agamemnon begins shifting to
hector thetis his mother rises from the sea floor and sympathizes with his grief she obtains magnificent new armor for him from hephaestus the goddess athena provides him with the aegis of zeus when he goes to the battlefield the entire trojan army flees behind the walls of troy achilles wrath is terrible and he slays many trojan warriors and allies including priam s son lycaon whom achilles had previously captured and sold into slavery but who had been returned to troy eventually hector comes out of the walls to defend the honour of troy he asked achilles
to agree that the body of the loser would be returned for proper burial by the winner achilles rejected this
arrangement saying though twenty ransoms and thy weight in gold were offered i
would refuse it all stories tell that hector ran about troy seven times and achilles followed him however seeing that achilles would not be outrun hector stood his ground and fought other versions of the tale say that achilles chased after hector two times and one time he was delivered by the gods however on their second encounter achilles trapped hector
and challenged him after a legendary fight achilles kills hector influenced by his anger he drags the body of hector behind his chariot round the walls of troy three times and refuses to allow it to receive funeral rites much to the dismay of achilles the body of hector miraculously heals and will not decay as normally expected aphrodite the goddess of love who sided with troy throughout the
whole conflict put a protective barrier over hector which kept him looking like he did before he was viciously killed by achilles when priam the king of troy and hector s father comes secretly into the greek camp to plead for the body achilles finally relents in one of the most moving scenes of the iliad he receives priam graciously and allows him to take the body
away the scene is intensely moving because priam the king of one of the greatest cities in the known world kneels down old and frail as he is and kisses the hands of the man who killed his son the greatness of achilles lies in not just being the greatest greek fighter ever but in knowing the
choice provided to him by destiny his mother thetis had prophesied to him that if he pulled out of the trojan war he would enjoy a long and a happy life if achilles fought however he would die before the walls of troy but assure an everlasting glory surpassing that of all other heroes he had made the choice and coming face
to face with it showed his greatness xanthos during the trojan war xanthos one of achilles horses was rebuked by achilles for allowing patroclus to be killed xanthos responded by saying hera temporarily gave him voice to do so that a god and a mortal had killed patroclus and a god and a mortal would soon kill achilles too memnon cycnus penthesilea and the death of achilles thetis rising from the sea to comfort achilles book one eight by thomas banks english one seven seven eight victoria

penthesilia with whom achilles also had an affair in some versions as predicted by hector with his dying breath achilles was thereafter killed by paris either by an arrow to the heel which may have subsequently become fatally infected and
is said to have been guided by apollo or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting polyxena a princess of troy both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor and achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles his bones are mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games are held like ajax he is represented
although not by homer as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the danube the fate of achilles armor achilles armor was
the object of a feud between odysseus and ajax the greater achilles older cousin they competed for it and odysseus won ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades he started killing cattle thinking they were greek soldiers and then himself other stories about achilles some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep
achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions
peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among lycomedes daughters under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia achilles fathered a son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s alias according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid he went
to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry but placed a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly
took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the trojan campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court
thus giving his identity away the story about achilles in drag is not found in homer in homer s odyssey there is a passage in which odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these
is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave than be dead this has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son alexander the great son of the
epiran princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to
have visited his tomb while passing troy achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea the homosexual relationship between achilles and patroclus is something much explored in post homeric literature by the fifth and fourth centuries the deep and arguably ambiguous friendship portrayed in homer blossomed into an unequivocal love affair
in the works of aeschylus plato and aeschines and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in lycophron s third century alexandra that claim achilles slayed troilus in a matter of unrequited love achilles fought and killed the amazon helene some also said he married medea and
that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica achilles in lost plays in the early one nine nine zero s a lost play by aeschylus was discovered in the wrappings of a mummy in egypt the play achilles was part of a trilogy about the trojan war it was known to exist due to mentions in ancient sources but had

the gettysburg address and took personal charge of plans for the abolition of slavery and the reconstruction of the union he was assassinated as the war ended by john wilkes booth role in history president lincoln was opposed to what he saw as the slave power and staunchly opposed its efforts to expand slavery into federal territories his victory in the one eight six zero presidential election further polarized an already divided nation before his inauguration in march of one eight six one seven southern states seceded from the united
states formed the confederate states of america and took control of u s forts and other properties within their boundaries these events soon led to the
american civil war lincoln is often praised for his work as a wartime leader who
proved adept at balancing competing considerations and at getting rival groups to work together toward a common goal lincoln had to negotiate between radical and moderate republican leaders who were often far apart on the issues while attempting to win support from war democrats and loyalists in the seceding states he personally directed the war effort in
close cooperation one eight six four six five with general ulysses
s grant which ultimately led the union forces to victory over the confederacy his leadership qualities were evident in his diplomatic handling of the border slave states at the beginning of the fighting in his defeat of a congressional attempt to reorganize his cabinet in one eight six two in
his many speeches and writings which helped mobilize and inspire the north and in his defusing of the peace issue in the one eight six four presidential campaign copperheads vehemently criticized him for violating the constitution overstepping the bounds of executive power refusing to compromise on slavery declaring martial law suspending habeas corpus ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and a number of newspaper publishers and killing hundreds of thousands of young men radical republicans
criticized him for going too slow on abolition of slavery and not being ruthless enough toward the conquered south lincoln is most famous for his roles in preserving the union and ending slavery in the united states with the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution however some abolitionists criticized him for only freeing the slaves under the confederacy in one eight six three and waiting until one eight six five to free slaves held in the union historians have argued that lincoln had a lasting influence on u
s political and social institutions importantly setting a precedent for greater centralization of powers in the federal government and the weakening of the powers of the individual state governments lincoln spent most of his attention on military matters and politics but with his strong support his administration established the current system of national banks with the national bank act he
increased the tariff to raise revenue and encourage factories imposed the first income tax issued hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds and greenbacks encouraged immigration from europe built the transcontinental railroad set up the department of agriculture encouraged farm ownership with the homestead act of one eight six two and set up the modern system of
state universities with the morrill land grant colleges act during the war his treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied south the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy during his administration west virginia and nevada were admitted as states lincoln is usually ranked as one of the greatest presidents because of his roles in destroying slavery redefining national values and saving the union his assassination made him a martyr to millions of
americans however others considered him an unconstitutional tyrant for declaring martial law suspending civil liberties habeas corpus and the first amendment and ordering the arrest of
thousands of public officials and newspaper publishers early life abraham lincoln was born on february one
two one eight zero nine in a one room log cabin on the three four eight acre one four km sinking spring farm in the southeast part
of hardin county kentucky then considered the frontier now part of larue co in nolin creek three miles five km south of hodgenville to thomas lincoln
and nancy hanks lincoln was named after his deceased grandfather who was scalped in one seven eight six in an indian raid he had no middle name lincoln s parents were uneducated illiterate farmers when lincoln became famous reporters and storytellers often exaggerated the poverty and obscurity of his birth however lincoln s father thomas was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the kentucky backcountry he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december one eight zero eight for two zero zero cash and assumption of a debt his parents belonged to a baptist church that had
pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support slavery from a very young age lincoln was exposed to anti slavery sentiment however he never joined his parents church or any other church and as a youth ridiculed religion three years after purchasing the property a prior land claim filed in hardin circuit court forced the lincolns to move thomas continued legal action until he lost the case in one eight one five legal expenses
contributed to family difficulties in one eight one one they were able to lease three zero acres zero one km of a two three zero acre zero nine km farm on knob creek a few miles away where they then moved in a valley of the rolling fork river this was some of the best farmland in the area
at this time lincoln s father was a respected community member and a successful farmer and carpenter lincoln s earliest recollections are from this farm in one eight one five another claimant sought to eject the family from the knob creek farm frustrated with litigation and lack of security provided by kentucky courts thomas decided
to move to indiana which had been surveyed by the federal government making land titles more secure it is possible that these episodes motivated abraham to later learn surveying and become an attorney in one eight one six when lincoln was seven years old he and his parents moved to spencer county indiana he would state partly on account of slavery and partly because of economic difficulties in kentucky in one eight one eight lincoln s mother died of milk sickness at age thirty four
when abe was nine soon afterwards lincoln s father remarried to sarah bush johnston sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see lincoln by david
herbert donald one nine nine five in one eight three zero after more economic and land title difficulties in indiana the family settled on government land on a site selected by lincoln s father in macon county illinois the following winter was especially brutal and
the family nearly moved back to indiana when his father relocated the family to a nearby site the following year the two two year old lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon
to sangamon county illinois now in menard county in the village of new salem later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction that left an indelible impression on him for the rest of his life whether he actually witnessed a slave auction at that time or not living in a country with a
considerable slave presence he probably saw similar atrocities from time to time his formal education consisted of perhaps one eight months of schooling from itinerant teachers in effect he was self educated studying every book he could borrow he mastered the bible shakespeare english history and american history and developed a plain style that puzzled audiences more used to orotund oratory he avoided hunting and fishing because he
did not like killing animals even for food and though unusually tall and strong spent so much time reading that some neighbors thought he must be doing
it to avoid strenuous manual labor he was skilled with an axe
they called him the rail splitter and a good wrestler young abraham lincoln early career lincoln began his political career in one eight three two at the age of two three with a campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river in the hopes of attracting steamboat traffic to
the river which would allow sparsely populated poor areas along and near the river to grow and prosper he served as a captain in a company of the illinois militia drawn from new salem during the black hawk war although he never saw combat he wrote after being elected by his peers that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction he later tried and failed at several small time
business ventures he held an illinois state liquor license and sold whiskey finally after coming across the second volume of sir william blackstone s four volume commentaries on the laws of england he taught
himself the law and was admitted to the illinois bar in one eight three seven that same year he moved to springfield illinois and began to practice law with stephen t logan he became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in the prairie state and grew steadily more prosperous lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as
a representative from sangamon county beginning in one eight three four he became a leader of the whig party in
the legislature in one eight three seven he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy lincoln shared a bed with
joshua fry speed from one eight three seven to one eight four one in springfield while many historians claim it was not uncommon in the mid one nine th century for men to share a bed just as two men today may share a house or an apartment gay activist c a tripp generated controversy with his two zero zero five book the intimate world of abraham lincoln which suggested their relationship may also have been sexual in one
eight four one lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig in one eight five
six both men joined the fledgling republican party following lincoln s assassination herndon began collecting stories about lincoln from those who knew him in central illinois eventually publishing
a book herndon s lincoln lincoln never joined an antislavery society and denied he supported the abolitionists he married into a prominent slave owning family from kentucky and allowed his
children to spend time there surrounded by slaves several of his in laws became confederate officers he greatly admired the science that flourished in new england and was perhaps the only father in illinois at the time to send his son robert todd
lincoln to elite eastern schools phillips exeter academy and harvard college marriage on november four one eight four two at the age of three three lincoln married mary todd the couple had four sons robert todd lincoln b august one one eight

in congress he used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the war with mexico which he attributed to president polk s desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood lincoln was a key early supporter of zachary
taylor s candidacy for the one eight four eight whig presidential nomination when lincoln s term ended the incoming taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote oregon territory acceptance would end his career in the fast growing state of illinois so
he declined returning instead to springfield illinois he turned most of his energies to making a living
at the bar which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county prairie lawyer by the mid one eight five zero s lincoln faced competing transportation interests both the river barges and the railroads in one eight four nine he received a patent related to buoying vessels lincoln represented the alton duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case
is famous for lincoln s use of judicial notice a rare tactic at that time to show
an eyewitness had lied on the stand claiming he witnessed the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmer s almanac to show that the moon on
that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly based upon this evidence armstrong was acquitted republican politics one eight five four one eight six zero the kansas nebraska act of one eight five four which expressly repealed the limits on slavery s spread that had been part of the missouri compromise of one eight two zero drew lincoln back into politics illinois democrat stephen a douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution
to the slavery impasse incorporating it into the kansas nebraska act douglas argued that in a democracy the people of a territory should decide whether to allow slavery or not and not have a decision imposed on them by congress it was a speech against kansas
nebraska on october one six one eight five four in peoria that caused lincoln to stand out among the other free soil orators of the day he helped form the new republican party drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in one eight five four and elected a senator lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep party unity he
allowed the election to go to his colleague lyman trumbull in one eight five seven five eight douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a terrific fight for control of the democratic party some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in one eight five eight since he led the opposition to the administration s
push for the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state accepting the republican nomination for the senate in one eight five eight lincoln delivered a famous speech in which he stated a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to
fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created a lasting image of the danger of disunion due to slavery and rallied republicans across the north the one eight five eight campaign featured the lincoln douglas debates a nationally noticed discussion on the issues that threatened to split
the nation in two lincoln forced douglas to propose his freeport doctrine which lost him further support among slave holders and speeded the division of the democratic party though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate nevertheless lincoln
s eloquence transformed him into a national political star during the debates of one eight five eight the issue of race was often discussed during a time period when racial egalitarianism was considered politically incorrect stephen douglas would inform the crowds
if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro official records of debate on the defensive lincoln countered that he was not
in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races official records of debate historians generally remained mixed on what
lincoln s actual views were on race however many tend to doubt that the
highly political nature of these debates offer reliable evidence about his personal views team of rivals by doris kearns goodwin two zero zero five lincoln in text and
context by donald fehrenbacher one nine eight seven as fredrick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the
difference between himself and myself of the difference of color life and times of fredrick douglass by fredrick douglass one eight nine five lincoln s opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power and he was not an abolitionist in one eight five eight but the civil war changed everything and changed lincoln s
beliefs in race relations as well election of one eight six zero the rail candidate political cartoon one eight six zero entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually
chosen as the republican candidate for the one eight six zero election for several reasons his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than rivals william h seward and salmon chase his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party
specifically seward who had run afoul of newspaperman horace greeley during the campaign lincoln was dubbed the rail splitter by republicans to emphasize the power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts on november six one eight six zero lincoln was elected the one six th president of the united states beating democrat douglas john c breckenridge of the southern democrats and john
c bell of the new constitutional union party lincoln was the first republican president
he won entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only two of nine nine six counties there lincoln gained one eight six five nine zero eight votes three nine nine of the total for one eight zero electoral votes douglas one three eight zero two zero two
two nine five for one two electoral votes breckenridge eight four eight zero one nine one eight one for seven two electoral
votes and bell five nine zero nine zero one one two
five for three nine electoral votes there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral
college and the election secession winter one eight six zero six one as lincoln s election became more and more probable secessionists made it clear that their states would
leave the union south carolina took the lead followed by six other cotton growing states georgia florida alabama mississippi louisiana and texas the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal they decided to stay in the union though warning lincoln they would not support an invasion through their territory the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves an entirely new nation the confederate states of america president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy president elect lincoln survived an assassination threat in
baltimore and on february two three one eight six one arrived in disguise in washington at lincoln s inauguration on march four one eight six one the turners formed lincoln s bodyguard
and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion or insurrection from confederates in the capital city photograph showing march four one eight six one inauguration of
abraham lincoln in front of u s capitol in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold
that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual and thus the constitution too was perpetual he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple
contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to unite the union and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution of which he had been a driving force it would have explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed and had already passed both houses lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise however
which would have permitted slavery in the territories renewing the boundary set by the missouri compromise and extending it to california despite support for this compromise among some republicans
lincoln declared that were the crittenden compromise accepted it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego
because opposition to slavery expansion was the key issue uniting the republican party at the time lincoln is sometimes criticized for putting politics ahead of the national interest in refusing any
compromise allowing the expansion of slavery supporters of lincoln however point out that he did not oppose slavery because he was a republican but became a republican because of his opposition to
the expansion of slavery that he opposed several other republicans who were in favor of compromise and that he clearly thought his course of action was in the national interest by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and not a single leader of that country ever proposed rejoining the union on any terms no compromise was found because no compromise was possible lincoln perhaps could have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s black joseph
holt and edwin m stanton had taken control of buchanan s cabinet around january one one eight six one and refused to accept secession lincoln and nearly all republican leaders adopted this nationalistic position by march one eight six one the union could not be broken war begins one eight six one one eight six two after union troops at fort sumter were
fired on and forced to surrender in april lincoln called on governors of every state to send seven five
zero zero zero troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state then seceded along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to
interfere with slavery in loyal states emancipation proclamation lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july two two one eight six two congress in july one eight six two moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act it provided that if
any person shall hereafter incite set on foot assist or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws thereof or shall give aid or comfort thereto or shall engage in or give aid and comfort to
any such existing rebellion or insurrection and be convicted thereof such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars and by the liberation of all his slaves if any he
have or by both of said punishments at the discretion of the court sec nine and be it further enacted that all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the united states or
who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and all slaves of such person found on or being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of
their servitude and not again held as slaves thus everyone who six zero days after july one seven one eight six two supported the rebellion was to be punished by having all their slaves freed the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners this did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the xiii amendment did that but it shows lincoln had the support of and was even somewhat pushed by congress in liberating the slaves
owned by rebels lincoln implemented the new law by his emancipation proclamation lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states and he personally opposed slavery
as a profound moral evil not in accord with the principle of equality asserted in the declaration of independence yet lincoln s views of the role of the federal government on the subject of slavery are more complicated before the confederate states seceded lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery into the territories
where congress did have authority however he maintained that the federal government could not constitutionally bar slavery in states where it already existed during his presidency lincoln made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery freeing the slaves was a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class lincoln was criticized both at home and abroad for his refusal to take a
stand for the complete abolition of slavery on august two two one eight six two a few weeks before signing the proclamation and after it had already been drafted lincoln responded by letter to an editorial by horace greeley of the new york tribune which had urged abolition i would save the union i would save it the shortest way under the constitution the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the
union as it was if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them if there be
those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery
i do not agree with them my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i
forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oft expressed
personal wish that all men everywhere could be free with the emancipation proclamation issued
in two parts on september two two one eight six two
and january one one eight six three lincoln made the abolition of slavery a goal of the war lincoln addresses the issue of his consistency or lack thereof between his
earlier position and his later position on emancipation in an one eight six four letter to albert g hodges lincoln is often credited with freeing enslaved african americans with the emancipation proclamation however border states that still allowed slavery but were under union control were exempt from the emancipation because they were not covered under any war measures the proclamation on its first day january one one eight six three freed only a few escaped slaves but
as union armies advanced south more and more slaves were liberated until hundreds of thousands were freed exactly how many is unknown lincoln signed the proclamation as a wartime measure
insisting that only the outbreak of war gave constitutional power to the president to free slaves in states where it already existed he later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper the proclamation made abolishing slavery in the rebel states an official war goal and it became the impetus for the enactment of the one three th amendment to the united states constitution which abolished slavery lincoln was one of the main
promoters of that amendment although some northern conservatives recoiled at the notion that the war was now being fought for the slaves instead of for preserving the union in
the end the emancipation proclamation did much to help the northern cause politically lincoln s strong abolitionist stand finally convinced the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and other foreign countries that they could not support the confederate states of america this move remains one of the great seizures of private property by the federal government restoring the
ownership of the blacks to themselves lincoln had for some time been working on plans to set up colonies in africa and south america for the nearly four million newly freed slaves he remarked upon colonization favorably in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such
a massive undertaking failed important domestic measures of lincoln s first term while lincoln is usually
portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in one eight six one at the suggestion of one one year old grace bedell lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws he was anti vescovian he signed them vetoing only bills that threatened his war powers thus he signed the homestead act in one eight six two making available millions of acres of government held land in the west for purchase at very low cost the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in one
eight six two provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state lincoln also signed the pacific railway acts of one eight six two and one eight six four which granted federal support to the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in one eight six nine the most important legislation involved money matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs most important was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of one eight six three one eight six four and one eight six
five which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system lincoln sent a senior general to put down the sioux uprising of august one eight six two in minnesota presented with three zero three death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln affirmed three nine of these for execution one was later reprieved one eight six four election and second inauguration after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in one eight
six three many in the north believed that victory was soon to come after lincoln appointed u s grant general in chief on march one two one eight six four although no president since andrew jackson had been elected to a second term and none since van
buren had been re nominated lincoln s re election was considered a certainty however when the spring campaigns east and west all turned into bloody stalemates northern morale dipped and lincoln seemed less likely to be re nominated treasury secretary salmon p chase strongly desired the republican nomination and was working hard to win it while john fremont was nominated by a breakoff group of radical republicans potentially taking away crucial votes in the november elections fearing he might lose the election lincoln wrote out and signed the following pledge but did not show it to his
cabinet asking them each to sign the sealed envelope lincoln wrote this morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re elected then it will be my duty to so co operate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he
will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards the democrats hoping to make setbacks in the war a top campaign issue waited until late summer to nominate a candidate their platform was heavily influenced by the peace wing of the party calling the war a failure but their candidate former general george mcclellan
was a war democrat determined to prosecute the war until the union was restored although willing to compromise on all other issues including slavery mcclellan s candidacy was
soon undercut as on september one just two days after the convention atlanta was abandoned by the confederate army coming on the heels of david farragut s capture of mobile bay and followed by phil sheridan s crushing victory over jubal early s army at cedar creek it was now
apparent that the tide had turned in favor of the union and that lincoln may be reelected despite the costs of the war still lincoln believed that he would win the electoral vote by only a slim margin failing to give him the mandate he d need if he was to push his lenient reconstruction plan to his surprise lincoln ended up winning all but two
states capturing two one two of two three three electoral votes after lincoln s election on march four one eight six five he delivered his second inaugural address which was his favorite of all his speeches at this time a victory over the rebels was within sight slavery had effectively ended and lincoln was looking to the future fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bond man s two hundred
and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind
up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations civil war and reconstruction conducting the war effort the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and it occupied nearly all of his time lincoln had a contentious relationship
with general george b mcclellan who became general in chief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement
of winfield scott in late one eight six one lincoln wished to take an active part in planning the war strategy despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln s strategic priorities were two fold first to ensure that washington d c was well defended and second to conduct an aggressive war effort in hopes of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press who pushed for an offensive war mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back
to military service took a more cautious approach mcclellan took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign which involved capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers mcclellan s delay irritated lincoln as did mcclellan s insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d c lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of
his peninsula campaign mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as general in chief after releasing his harrison s landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint fellow republican john pope as head of the new army of virginia pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire for the union to move towards richmond from the north thus guarding washington d c however pope was
soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run during the summer of one eight six two forcing the army of the potomac back into the defenses of washington for a second time pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux panicked by confederate general robert e lee s invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle
of antietam in september one eight six two it was
the union victory in that battle that allowed lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation lincoln relieved mcclellan of command shortly after the one eight six two midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac who promised to follow through on lincoln s strategic vision for an aggressive offensive against lee and richmond after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given command despite his idle talk about becoming a military strong man hooker was routed by lee at chancellorsville in may one
eight six three and also relieved of command after the union victory at gettysburg meade s failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac lincoln decided to
bring in a western general general ulysses s grant he had a solid string of victories in the western theater including vicksburg and chattanooga earlier reacting to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man he fights grant waged his bloody overland campaign in one eight six four using a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher losses in the confederate army grant s aggressive campaign would eventually
bottle up lee in the siege of petersburg and result in the union taking richmond and bringing the war to a close in the spring of one eight six five lincoln authorized grant to use a scorched earth approach to destroy the south s morale and economic ability to continue the war
this allowed generals william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina the damage in sherman s march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of one zero zero million lincoln had a star crossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg
and the importance of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing cities however he had little success in his efforts to motivate his generals to adopt his strategies eventually he found in grant a man who shared his vision of the war and was able to bring that vision to reality with his relentless pursuit of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters of war lincoln perhaps reflecting his lack of military experience developed a keen curiosity with military campaigning during the war he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals through many
a night he frequently visited battle sites and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war during jubal a early s raid into washington d c in one eight six four lincoln had to be told to duck his head to avoid being shot while observing the scenes of battle homefront lincoln was more successful in
giving the war meaning to northern civilians through his oratorical skills despite his meager education and backwoods upbringing lincoln possessed an extraordinary command of the english language as evidenced by the gettysburg
address a speech dedicating a cemetery of union soldiers from the battle of gettysburg that he delivered on november one nine one eight six three while the featured speaker orator edward everett spoke for two hours lincoln s few choice words resonated across the nation and across history defying lincoln s own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here
lincoln s second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted in these speeches lincoln articulated better than any of his contemporaries the rationale behind the union effort during the civil war lincoln exercised powers no previous president had wielded he proclaimed a
blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned thousands of accused confederate sympathizers without trial there is a fragment of uncorraborated evidence that lincoln made contingency plans to arrest chief justice roger brooke taney though the allegation remains unresolved and controversial see the taney arrest warrant controversy the long war and the issue of emancipation appeared to be severely hampering his prospects and pessimists warned that defeat appeared
likely lincoln ran under the union party banner composed of war democrats and republicans general grant was facing severe criticism for his conduct of the bloody overland campaign that summer and the seemingly endless siege of petersburg however the union capture of the key railroad center of atlanta by sherman s forces in september changed the situation dramatically and lincoln was reelected reconstruction the reconstruction of the union weighed heavy on the president s mind throughout the
war effort he was determined to take a course that would not permanently alienate the former confederate states and throughout the war lincoln urged speedy elections under generous terms in areas behind union lines this irritated congressional republicans who urged a more stringent reconstruction policy one of lincoln s few vetoes during his term was of the wade davis bill an effort by congressional republicans to impose harsher reconstruction terms on the confederate areas republicans in congress retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected
from louisiana arkansas and tennessee during the war under lincoln s generous terms let em up easy he told his assembled military leaders gen ulysses s grant a future president gen william t sherman and adm david dixon porter in an one eight six five meeting on the steamer river queen when richmond the confederate capital was at long last captured lincoln went there to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson davis s own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united
states held authority over the entire land he was greeted at the city as a
conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer s quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him on april nine one eight six five confederate general robert e lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia this left only joseph johnston s forces in the east to deal with weeks later johnston would defy jefferson davis and surrender his forces to sherman of
course lincoln would not survive to see the surrender of all confederate forces just five days after lee surrendered lincoln was assassinated he was the first
president to be assassinated and the third to die in office assassination the assassination of abraham lincoln from left to right henry rathbone clara harris mary todd lincoln lincoln and booth lincoln had met frequently with lt gen ulysses s
grant as the war drew to a close the two men planned matters of reconstruction and it was evident to all that they held each other in high regard during their last meeting on april one four one eight six five good
friday lincoln invited grant to a social engagement that evening grant declined grant s wife julia dent grant is said to have strongly disliked mary todd lincoln the president s eldest son
robert todd lincoln also turned down the invitation john wilkes booth a well known actor and southern sympathizer from maryland heard that the president and mrs lincoln along with the grants would be attending ford
s theatre having failed in a plot to kidnap lincoln earlier booth informed his co conspirators of his intention to kill lincoln others were assigned to assassinate vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william seward without his bodyguard ward hill lamon to
whom he related his famous dream of his own assassination the lincolns left to attend the play at ford s theater the play our american cousin was a musical comedy by the british writer tom taylor as lincoln sat in his state box in the balcony booth crept up behind the president s box and waited for the funniest line of the play hoping the laughter would cover the gunshot noise on stage actor harry hawk said the last words lincoln would ever hear well i guess i know enough to turn you inside out
old gal you sockdologizing old man trap when the laughter came booth
jumped into the box the president was in and aimed a single shot round slug four four caliber deringer at his head firing at point blank range
the bullet entered behind lincoln s left ear and lodged behind his right eyeball major henry rathbone who was present in the presidential box momentarily grappled with booth but was
severely stabbed and slashed by the assassin it was believed that booth then shouted sic semper tyrannis latin thus always to tyrants the state motto of virginia some accounts say he added the south is avenged and jumped from the balcony to the stage below breaking his leg despite his injury booth managed to limp to his horse
and make his escape as booth fled from the theater a young physician dr charles leale made his way through the audience to lincoln s box leale quickly assessed the wound as mortal the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a
coma for nine hours before he expired several physicians attended lincoln including u s army surgeon general joseph k barnes of the army medical museum using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincoln s skull and the ball lodged six inches inside

aristotle aristotel s three eight four bc march seven three two two bc was an ancient greek philosopher who studied with plato and taught alexander the great he wrote books on many subjects including physics poetry zoology logic rhetoric government and biology aristotle along with plato and socrates is generally considered one of the most influential of ancient
greek philosophers they transformed presocratic greek philosophy into the foundations of western philosophy as we know it the writings of plato and aristotle founded two of the most important schools of ancient philosophy aristotle valued knowledge gained from the senses and in modern terms would
be classed among the modern empiricists see materialism and empiricism he also achieved a grounding of dialectic in the topics by allowing interlocutors to begin from commonly held beliefs endoxa his goal being non contradiction rather than truth he set the stage for what would eventually develop into the empiricist version of scientific method centuries later although he wrote dialogues early in his career no more
than fragments of these have survived the works of aristotle that still exist today are in treatise
form and were for the most part unpublished texts these
were probably lecture notes or texts used by his students and were almost certainly
revised repeatedly over the course of years as a result
these works tend to be eclectic dense and difficult to read among the most important ones are physics metaphysics or ontology nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics these works although connected in many fundamental ways are very different in both style and substance aristotle is known for being one of the few figures in history who studied almost every subject possible at the time in science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy economics embryology geography geology
meteorology physics and zoology in philosophy aristotle wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics psychology rhetoric and theology he also dealt with education foreign customs literature and poetry his combined works practically constitute an encyclopedia of greek knowledge biography early life and studies at the academy a bust of aristotle is a nearly ubiquitous ornament in places of high culture in the west aristotle was born at stageira a colony of andros on the macedonian peninsula of chalcidice
in three eight four bc his father nicomachus was court physician to king amyntas iii of macedon it is believed that aristotle s ancestors held this position under various kings of the macedons as such aristotle
s early education would probably have consisted of instruction in medicine and biology from his father about his mother phaestis little is known it is known that she died early in aristotle s life when nicomachus also died in aristotle s tenth year he was left an orphan and placed under the guardianship of his uncle proxenus of atarneus he taught aristotle greek rhetoric and poetry o connor et al two zero zero four aristotle was probably influenced by his father s medical knowledge when he went to athens at the age of one eight he was likely already
trained in the investigation of natural phenomena from the age of one eight to three seven aristotle remained in athens as a pupil of plato and distinguished himself at the academy the relations between plato and aristotle have formed the subject of various legends many of which depict aristotle unfavourably no doubt there were divergences of opinion between plato who took
his stand on sublime idealistic principles and aristotle who even at that time showed a preference for the investigation of the facts and laws of the physical world it is also probable that plato suggested that aristotle needed restraining rather than encouragement but not that
there was an open breach of friendship in fact aristotle s conduct after the death of plato his continued association with xenocrates and other platonists and his allusions in his writings to plato s doctrines prove that while there were conflicts of opinion between plato and aristotle there was no lack of cordial appreciation or mutual forbearance besides this the legends that reflect aristotle unfavourably are traceable to the epicureans who were known as slanderers
if such legends were circulated widely by patristic writers such as justin martyr and gregory nazianzen the reason lies in the exaggerated esteem
aristotle was held in by the early christian heretics not in any well grounded historical tradition aristotle as philosopher and tutor after the death of plato three four seven bc aristotle was considered as the next head of the academy a position that was eventually awarded to plato s nephew aristotle then went with xenocrates to the court of hermias ruler of atarneus in asia minor and married his niece and adopted daughter pythia
in three four four bc hermias was murdered in a rebellion and aristotle went with his family to mytilene it is also reported that he stopped on lesbos and briefly conducted biological research then
one or two years later he was summoned to pella the macedonian capital by king philip ii of macedon to become the tutor of alexander the great who was then one three plutarch wrote that aristotle not only imparted to
alexander a knowledge of ethics and politics but also of the most profound secrets of philosophy we have much proof that alexander profited by contact with the philosopher and that aristotle made prudent and beneficial use of his influence over the young prince although bertrand russell disputes this due to this influence alexander provided aristotle with ample means for the acquisition of books and the pursuit of his scientific investigation it is possible that aristotle also participated in the education of alexander s boyhood friends which
may have included for example hephaestion and harpalus aristotle maintained a long correspondence with hephaestion eventually collected into a book unfortunately now lost according to sources such as plutarch and diogenes philip had aristotle s hometown of stageira burned during the three four zero s bc and aristotle successfully requested that alexander rebuild
it during his tutorship of alexander aristotle was reportedly considered a second time for leadership of the academy his companion xenocrates was selected instead founder and master of the lyceum in about three three five bc alexander departed for his asiatic campaign and aristotle who had served as an informal adviser more or less since
alexander ascended the macedonian throne returned to athens and opened his own school of philosophy he may as
aulus gellius says have conducted a school of rhetoric during his former residence in athens but now following plato s example he gave regular instruction in philosophy in a gymnasium
dedicated to apollo lyceios from which his school has come to be known as the lyceum it was also called the peripatetic school because aristotle preferred to discuss problems of philosophy with his pupils while walking up and down peripateo the shaded walks peripatoi around the gymnasium during the thirteen years three three five bc three two two bc which he spent as teacher of the lyceum aristotle composed most of
his writings imitating plato he wrote dialogues in which his doctrines were expounded in somewhat popular language he also composed the several treatises which will be mentioned below on physics metaphysics and so forth in which the
exposition is more didactic and the language more technical than in the dialogues these writings show to what good use he put the resources
alexander had provided for him they show particularly how he succeeded in bringing together the works of his predecessors in greek philosophy and how he pursued either personally or through others his investigations in the realm of natural phenomena pliny claimed that alexander placed under aristotle s orders all the hunters fishermen and fowlers of the royal kingdom and all the
overseers of the royal forests lakes ponds and cattle ranges and aristotle s works on zoology make this statement more believable aristotle was fully informed about the doctrines of his predecessors and strabo asserted that he was the first to accumulate a great library during the last years of aristotle s life the relations between him and alexander became very strained owing to the disgrace and punishment of callisthenes whom aristotle had recommended to alexander nevertheless aristotle
continued to be regarded at athens as a friend of alexander and a representative of macedonia consequently when alexander s death became known in athens and the outbreak occurred which led to the lamian war aristotle shared in the general unpopularity of the macedonians the charge of impiety which had been brought against anaxagoras and socrates was now with even less reason brought against aristotle he left the city saying according to many ancient authorities that he would not give the athenians a
chance to sin a third time against philosophy he took up residence at his country house at chalcis in euboea and there he died the following year three two two bc his death was due to a disease reportedly of the stomach from which he had long suffered the story that his death was due to hemlock poisoning as well as the legend that he threw himself into the sea because he could not explain the tides is without historical foundation very little is known about aristotle s personal appearance except
from hostile sources the statues and busts of aristotle possibly from the first years of the peripatetic school represent him as sharp and keen of countenance and somewhat below the average height his character as revealed by his writings his will which is undoubtedly
genuine fragments of his letters and the allusions of his unprejudiced contemporaries was that of a high minded kind hearted man devoted to his family and his friends kind to his slaves fair to his enemies and rivals grateful towards his benefactors when platonism ceased to dominate the world of christian speculation and the works of aristotle began to be studied without fear and prejudice the personality of aristotle appeared to the christian writers of the one three th century as it had to the unprejudiced pagan writers of his own day as calm majestic untroubled by passion and undimmed
by any great moral defects the master of those who know aristotle s legacy also had a profound influence on islamic thought and philosophy during the middle ages the likes of avicenna farabi and yaqub ibn ishaq al kindi one were a few of the major proponents of the aristotelian school of
thought during the golden age of islam methodology aristotle defines philosophy in terms of essence saying that philosophy is the science of the universal essence of that which is actual plato had defined it as the science of the idea meaning by idea what we should call the unconditional basis of phenomena both pupil and master regard philosophy as concerned with the universal aristotle however finds the universal in particular things and called it the essence of things while plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar for
aristotle therefore philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences while for plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas in a certain sense aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while plato s is essentially deductive in aristotle s terminology the term natural philosophy
corresponds to the phenomena of the natural world which include motion light and the laws of physics many centuries later these subjects would become the basis
of modern science as studied through the scientific method in modern times the term philosophy has come to be more narrowly understood as metaphysics distinct from empirical study of the natural world via the physical sciences
in contrast in aristotle s time and use philosophy was taken to encompass all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word he makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also called science note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that which is covered by the scientific method all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical by practical science he understands ethics and politics by
poetical he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts while by theoretical philosophy he means physics mathematics and metaphysics the last philosophy in the stricter sense he defines as the knowledge of immaterial being and calls it first philosophy the theologic science or of being in the highest degree of abstraction if logic or as aristotle calls it analytic be
regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy we have as divisions of aristotelian philosophy one logic two theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics mathematics three
practical philosophy and four poetical philosophy aristotle s epistemology logic history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak about boche ski one nine five one however plato reports that syntax was thought of before him by prodikos of keos who was concerned by the right use of words logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers
used concepts like reductio ad absurdum as a rule when discussing but never understood its logical
implications even plato had difficulties with logic although he had the idea of
constructing a system for deduction he was never able to construct one instead he relied on his dialectic which was a confusion between different sciences and methods boche ski one nine five one plato thought that deduction would simply follow from premises so he focused on having good premises so that the conclusion would follow later on plato realised that a method for obtaining the conclusion
would be beneficial plato never obtained such a method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method rose one nine six eight analytics and the organon what we call today aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books at about the time of christ categories
on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings there is one volume of aristotle s concerning logic not found in
the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics boche ski one nine five one modal logic aristotle is also the creator of syllogisms with modalities modal logic the
word modal refers to the word modes explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of truth aristotle introduced the qualification of necessary and possible premises he constructed a logic which helped in the evaluation of truth but which was very difficult to interpret rose one nine six eight science aristotle by francesco hayez aristotelian discussions about science had only been qualitative not
quantitative by the modern definition of the term aristotelian philosophy was not science as this worldview did not attempt to probe how the world actually worked through experiment for example in his book the history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females had he only made some
observations he would have discovered that this claim is false rather based on what one s senses told one aristotelian philosophy then depended upon the assumption that man s mind could elucidate all the laws of the universe based on simple observation without experimentation through reason alone one of the reasons for this was that aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own in this philosophy he
could not imagine that there was a relationship between them in contrast today s science assumes that thinking alone often leads people astray and therefore one must compare one s ideas to the
actual world through experimentation only then can one see if one s ideas are based in reality this position is known as empiricism or the scientific method although aristotle initiated an important step in the history of scientific method by founding logic as a formal science he also left behind a trail of bankrupt cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics his cosmology would gain much acceptance up until the one five zero zero s where
copernicus and galileo began to figure out that europe is not the center of the universe from the three rd century to the one five zero zero s the
dominant view held that the earth was the center of the universe at this late date it is uncontroversial that the earth is not even the center of our own solar system in spite of aristotle s bogus account of the planets and sun he is a vital character in the history of metaphysics both in terms of the etymology of the word as well as a figure within metaphysics as a discipline dubbed the stuff
next to the physics by andronicus of rhodes metaphysics became connected to the idea of beyond the physical by simplicius a commentator on aristotle andronicus had published aristotle s works sometime around four three two zero bc so initially the etymology of metaphysics was simply that which is next to the physics aristotle s metaphysics causality aristole is the first who saw that all causes of things are beginnings that we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause that to
know a thing s existence is to know the reason for its existence setting the guidelines for all the subsequent causal theories by specifying the number nature principles elements varieties order and modes of causation aristotle s account of the causes of things is the most comprehensive
theory up to now according to aristotle s theory all the causes fall into several senses
the total number of which amounts to the ways the question why may be answered namely by reference to the matter or
the substratum the essence the pattern the form or the structure to the primary moving change or the agent and its action and to the goal the plan the end or the good consequently the major kinds of causes come under the following divisions the material cause is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts constituents substratum or materials this reduces the explanation of causes to the parts factors elements constituents ingredients forming the whole system structure compound complex composite or combination the part whole
causation the formal cause tells us what a thing is that any thing
is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts the whole part causation the efficient cause is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts
it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is
changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions
of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or
states of affairs the final cause is that for the
sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve or it is that from which and that to which the change is this also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition need motivation or motives rational irrational ethical all that gives purpose to behavior additionally things can be causes of one another causing
each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or action
or influence of cause and effect also aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absent may result in different outcomes besides aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic the same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects essentiallly causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect
all further investigations of causality will be consisting in imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes like as final efficient material formal aquinas or in restricting all causality to the material
and efficient causes or to the efficient causality deterministic or chance or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores chance and spontaneity spontaneity and chance are causes of effects chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance for a better understanding of aristotle s
conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place for example a person seeks donations that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by
that particular donator a result of chance it must be unusual that something happens by chance in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance however chance can only apply to human beings it is in the sphere of moral
actions according to aristotle chance must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance physics two six the five elements fire which is hot and dry earth which is cold
and dry air which is hot and wet water which is cold and wet aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavens these four elements interchange i e fire air water earth etc while aether is on its own the sun keeps this cycle going god keeps the
sun going and thus the sun is eternal aristotle s ethics although aristotle wrote several works on ethics the major one was the nicomachean ethics which is considered one of aristotle s greatest works it discusses virtues the ten books which comprise it are based on notes from his lectures at the lyceum and were either edited by or dedicated to aristotle s son nicomachus aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge like metaphysics and epistemology but general knowledge also as it is a practical discipline rather than a theoretical one he thought that in order to become
good one could not simply study what virtue is one must actually do virtuous deeds in order to do this aristotle had first to establish what was virtuous he began by determining that everything
was done with some goal in mind and that goal is good the ultimate goal he called the highest good aristotle contested that happiness could not be found only in pleasure or only in fame and honor he finally finds happiness by ascertaining the specific function of man but what is this function that will bring happiness to determine this aristotle analyzed the soul and found it to have three parts the nutritive soul plants animals and humans the perceptive soul animals and humans and the rational soul humans only thus a human s function is to do
what makes it human to be good at what sets it apart from everything else the ability to reason or nous a person that does this is the happiest because they are
fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul depending on how well they did this aristotle said people belonged to one of four categories the virtuous the continent the incontinent and the vicious aristotle believes that every ethical virtue is an intermediate condition between excess and deficiency this does not mean aristotle believed in moral relativism however he set certain emotions e g hate envy jealousy
spite etc and certain actions e g adultery theft murder etc as always wrong
regardless of the situation or the circumstances nicomachean ethics in nicomachean ethics aristotle focuses on the importance of continually behaving virtuously and developing virtue rather than committing specific good actions this can be contrasted with kantian ethics in which
the primary focus is on individual action nicomachean ethics emphasizes the importance of context to ethical behaviour what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another aristotle believed that happiness is
the end of life and that as long as a person is striving for goodness good deeds will result from that struggle making the person virtuous and therefore happy aristotle s critics plato left and aristotle right a detail of the school of athens a fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience whilst plato points up to the heavens showing his belief in the ultimate truth aristotle has been criticised on several grounds his analysis of procreation
is frequently criticised on the grounds that it presupposes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive lumpen female element it is on these grounds that some feminist critics refer to aristotle as a misogynist at times the objections that aristotle raises against the
arguments of his own teacher plato appear to rely on faulty interpretations of those arguments although aristotle advised against plato that knowledge of the world could only be obtained through experience he frequently failed to take his own advice aristotle conducted projects of careful empirical investigation but often drifted into abstract logical reasoning with the result that his work was littered with conclusions that were
not supported by empirical evidence for example his assertion that objects of different mass fall at different speeds under gravity which was later refuted by john philoponus credit is often given to galileo even though philopinus lived centuries earlier in the middle ages roughly from the one two th century to the one five th century the philosophy of aristotle became firmly established dogma although aristotle
himself was far from dogmatic in his approach to philosophical inquiry two aspects of his philosophy might have assisted its transformation into dogma his works were wide ranging and systematic so that they could give the impression that no significant matter had been left unsettled he was also much less inclined to employ the
skeptical methods of his predecessors socrates and plato some academics have suggested that aristotle was unaware of much of the current science of his own time aristotle was called not a great philosopher but the philosopher by scholastic
thinkers these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the loss of his works though we know that aristotle wrote many elegant treatises cicero described his literary style as a river of gold the originals have been lost in time all that we have now are the literary notes for his pupils which are often difficult to read the nicomachean
ethics is a good example it is now believed that we have about one fifth of his original works aristotle underestimated the importance of his written work for humanity he thus never published his books except from his dialogues the story of the original manuscripts of his treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his
parallel lives sulla the manuscripts were left from aristotle to theophrastus from theophrastus to neleus of scepsis from neleus to his heirs their descendants sold them to apellicon of teos when sulla occupied athens in eight six bc he carried off the library of
appellicon to rome where they were first published in six zero bc
from the grammarian tyrranion of amisus and then by philosopher andronicus of rhodes bibliography note bekker numbers are often used to uniquely identify passages of aristotle they are identified below where

have been products of aristotle s successors at the lyceum e g theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus a final category omitted here includes medieval palmistries astrological and magical texts whose connection to aristotle is purely fanciful and self promotional those that are seriously disputed are

the international bureau of weights and measures is in charge of the realization of tai the highest
precision realization of tai times can only be determined retrospectively as the timescale is defined by periodic comparisons among its participating atomic clocks however these corrections are usually only needed for applications that require nanosecond scale accuracy most time service users use realtime estimates of
tai provided by atomic clocks that have been previously referenced to the composite timescale gps is a commonly used realtime source of time traceable back to tai coordinated universal time utc is the basis for legal time throughout much of the world and always differs from tai by an integral number of seconds from one january two zero zero six utc was behind tai by three three seconds the difference is due to an initial ten second offset on one january one nine seven two when utc was established and leap seconds which have been periodically inserted into utc
since the first on three zero june one nine seven two due to slight irregularities in earth s rate of rotation while tai is a continuous and stable timescale utc has intentional discontinuities to
keep it from drifting more than zero nine second from ut one a timescale defined by the earth s rotation roughly speaking solar noon the time at which the sun is directly overhead would

fundamental property of human nature altruism can refer to being helpful to other people with little or no interest in being rewarded for one s efforts the colloquial definition this is distinct from merely helping others actions that benefit others with a net detrimental or neutral effect on the actor regardless of the actor s own psychology motivation or the cause of his or her actions this type of altruistic behavior is referred to in ecology as commensalism an ethical doctrine that holds that individuals have a moral obligation to
help others if necessary to the exclusion of one s own interest or benefit one who holds such a doctrine is known as an altruist the concepts have a long history in philosophical and ethical thought and have more recently become a topic for psychologists sociologists evolutionary biologists and ethologists while ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism altruism can be distinguished from
a feeling of loyalty and duty altruism focuses on a moral obligation towards all humanity while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual e g a king a specific organization e g a government or an abstract concept e g god country etc some individuals may feel both altruism and duty while others may not as opposed to
altruism duty is much easier to enforce by an authority altruism in ethics main article altruism ethical doctrine the word altruism french altruisme from autrui other people derived from latin alter other was coined by auguste comte the french founder of positivism in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported he believed that individuals had a moral obligation to serve the interest of others or
the greater good of humanity comte says in his catechisme positiviste that the social point of
view cannot tolerate the notion of rights for such notion rests on individualism we are born under a load of obligations of every kind to our predecessors to our successors to our
contemporaries after our birth these obligations increase or accumulate for it is some time before we can return any service this to live for others the definitive formula of human morality gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence the common
source of happiness and duty man must serve humanity whose we are entirely as the name of the ethical doctrine is altruism doing what the ethical doctrine prescribes has also come to be referred to by the term altruism serving others through placing their interests above one s own however the idea that one has a moral obligation
to serve others is much older than auguste comte for example many of the world s oldest and most widespread religions particularly buddhism and christianity advocate it in the new testament of the christian bible it is explained as follows jesus made answer and said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he fell among robbers who both stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance a certain
priest was going down that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and in like manner a levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with compassion and came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on them oil and wine and he set him on his own beast and
brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow he took out two shillings and gave them to the host and said take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more i when i come back again will repay thee which of these three thinkest thou proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers and he said he
that showed mercy on him and jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise luke one zero three zero three seven philosophers
who support egoism have argued that altruism is demeaning to the individual and that no moral obligation to help others actually exists nietzsche asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others are more important than one s self and that such a position is degrading and demeaning he also claims that it was very
uncommon for people in europe to consider the sacrifice of one s own interests for others as virtuous until after the advent of christianity ayn rand argued that altruism is
the willful sacrifice of one s values and represents the reversal of morality because only a rationally selfish ethics allows one to pursue the values required for human life
advocates of altruism as an ethical doctrine maintain that one ought to act or refrain from acting so that benefit or good is bestowed on other people if necessary to the exclusion of one s own interests note that refraining from murdering someone for example is not altruism since he is not receiving a benefit or being helped as he already has his life this would amount to the same thing
as ignoring someone altruism in ethology and evolutionary biology in the science of ethology the study of behavior altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor this would appear to be counter intuitive if one presumes that natural selection acts on the individual natural selection however acts on the gene pool of the subjects not on each subject individually recent developments in game theory have provided some explanations for apparent altruism as have traditional
evolutionary analyses among the proposed mechanisms are behavioral manipulation e g by certain parasites that can alter the behavior of the host see bounded rationality e g herbert simon conscience indirect reciprocity e g reputation kin selection including eusociality see also selfish gene memes by influencing behavior to favour their
own spread e g religion reciprocal altruism mutual aid sexual selection strong reciprocity the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r price s development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body social
behavior and altruism share many similaraties to the interactions between the many parts cells genes of an organism but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an
absolute requirement for its neighbors altruism in psychology and sociology if one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit then it is not an altruistically motivated act there are several different perspectives on how benefit or interest should be defined a material gain e g money a physical reward etc is clearly a form of benefit while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains affection respect happiness satisfaction etc as being philosophically identical benefits according to psychological egoism while people can exhibit altruistic
behavior they cannot have altruistic motivations psychological egoists would say that while they might very well spend their lives benefitting others with no material benefit or a material net loss to themselves their most basic motive for doing so is always to further their own interests for example it would be alleged that the foundational motive
behind a person acting this way is to advance their own psychological well being good feeling critics of this theory often reject it on the grounds that it is non falsifiable in other words it is designed in such a way as to be impossible to prove or disprove because immaterial gains such as a good feeling cannot be measured or proven to exist in all people performing altruistic acts psychological egoism
has also been accused of using circular logic if a person willingly performs an
act that means he derives personal enjoyment from it therefore people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment this statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment in contrast to psychological egoism the empathy altruism
hypothesis states that when an individual experiences empathy towards someone in need the individual will then be altruistically motivated to help that person that is the individual will be primarily concerned about that person s welfare not his or her own in common parlance altruism usually means
helping another person without expecting material reward from that or other persons although it may well entail the internal benefit of a good feeling sense of satisfaction self esteem fulfillment of duty whether imposed by a religion or ideology or simply one s conscience or the like in this way one need not speculate on the motives of the altruist in question humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members previous co operators or potential future
allies but can be altruistic towards people they don t know and will never meet for example humans donate to international charities and
volunteer their time to help society s less fortunate it strains plausibility to claim that these altruistic deeds are done in the hope of a return favor the game theory analysis of this just in case strategy where the principle would be always help everyone in case you need to pull in a favor in return is a decidedly non optimal strategy where the net expenditure of effort tit is far greater than the net profit when it occasionally pays off tat according to some it
is difficult to believe that these behaviors are solely explained as indirect selfish rationality be it conscious or sub conscious mathematical formulations of kin
selection along the lines of the prisoner s dilemma are helpful as far as they go but what a game theoretic explanation glosses over is the fact that altruistic behavior can be attributed to that apparently mysterious phenomenon the conscience one recent suggestion proposed by the philosopher daniel dennett was initially developed when considering the problem of so called free riders in the tragedy of the commons a larger scale version of the prisoner s dilemma in game theory terms a free rider is
an agent who draws benefits from a co operative society without contributing in a one to one situation free riding can easily be discouraged by a tit for tat strategy but in a larger scale society where contributions and benefits are pooled and shared they can be incredibly difficult to shake off imagine
an elementary society of co operative organisms co operative agents interact with each other each contributing resources and each drawing on the common good now imagine a
rogue free rider an agent who draws a favor you scratch my back and later refuses to return it the problem is that free riding is always going to be beneficial to individuals at cost to society how can well behaved co operative agents avoid being cheated over many generations one obvious solution is for co operators to evolve the ability to spot potential free riders in advance and refuse
to enter into reciprocal arrangements with them then the canonical free rider response is to evolve a more convincing disguise fooling
co operators into co operating after all this can lead to an evolutionary arms races with ever more sophisticated disguises and ever more sophisticated detectors in this evolutionary arms race how best might one convince comrades that one really is a genuine co operator not a free rider in disguise one answer is by actually making oneself a genuine co operator by erecting psychological barriers to breaking promises and by advertising this fact to everyone else in other words a good solution is for organisms
to evolve things that everyone knows will force them to be co operators and to make it obvious that they ve evolved these things so evolution will produce organisms who are sincerely moral and who wear their hearts on their sleeves in short evolution will give
rise to the phenomenon of conscience this theory combined with ideas of kin selection and the one to one sharing of benefits may explain how a blind and fundamentally selfish process can produce a genuinely non cynical form of altruism that gives rise to the human conscience critics of such technical game theory analysis point out that it appears to forget that human beings
are rational and emotional to presume an analysis of human behaviour without
including human rationale or emotion is necessarily unrealistically narrow and treats human beings as if they are mere machines sometimes called homo economicus another objection is that often people donate anonymously so that it is impossible to determine if they really did the altruistic act beginning with an understanding that rational
human beings benefit from living in a benign universe logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place comparison of altruism and
tit for tat studying the simple strategy tit for tat in the iterated prisoner s dilemma problem game theorists argue that tit
for tat is much more successful in establishing stable cooperation among individuals than altruism defined as unconditional cooperation can ever be tit for tat starts with cooperation in the first step as altruism does and then just imitates
the behaviour of the partner step by step if the partner cooperates then he rewards him with cooperation if he doesn t then he punishes him by not cooperating in the next step confronted with many strategies that try to exploit or abuse cooperation of others this simple strategy surprisingly proved to be the most successful see the evolution of cooperation it was even more successful than these abusing strategies while unconditional cooperativity altruism was one of the most unsuccessful strategies confronted with altruistic behaviour
tit for tat is indistinguishable from pure altruism robert axelrod and richard
dawkins also showed that altruism may be harmful to society by nourishing exploiters and abusers and making them more and more powerful until they can force everyone to cooperate unconditionally which is not the case for tit for tat see also
comparison of entrepreneur and entredonneur in the context of biology the tit for tat strategy is also called reciprocal altruism altruism in politics there is currently a pov dispute as to the wording of the section shown below if one is an adherent to the ethical doctrine called altruism that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others then one will support the kind of politics that one believes
to be most effective in furthering the welfare of others regardless of the effect this may have on oneself since there is no general consensus on what kind of politics results in the greatest benefit for others different altruists may have very different
political views with regard to their political convictions altruists may be divided in two broad groups those who believe altruism is a matter of personal choice and therefore selfishness can and should be tolerated and those who believe that altruism is a moral ideal which should be embraced if possible by all human beings a prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is
lysander spooner who in natural law writes man no doubt owes many other moral duties to his fellow men such as to feed the hungry clothe the naked shelter the homeless care for the sick protect the defenceless assist the weak and enlighten the ignorant but these are simply moral duties of which each man must be his own judge in each particular case as to whether and how and how
far he can or will perform them the latter branch of altruist political thought on the other hand argues that egoism should be actively discouraged and that altruists have a duty not only to help other people but to teach those people to help each other as well thus in politics these
altruists almost always take a left wing stance ranging from moderate social democracy to socialism or even communism moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of taxation funded government programs aimed at benefiting the needy for example transfer payments such as social welfare or public healthcare and public education less obvious things such as a law that motorists pull over to let emergency vehicles pass may also be justified by appealing to the altruism ethic finally
radical altruists of this branch may take things further and advocate some form of collectivism or communalism on a somewhat related note altruism is often held even by non altruists to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions
of power such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace when they do not they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own politicians often speak of a
moral obligation of individuals to help others for example george bush speaking to the united nations said we have a moral obligation to help others and a moral duty to make sure our actions are effective if one is an adherent to the ethical doctrine called altruism that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others it can become a moral justification for forcing or advocating
forcing individuals to help others in the realm of politics the altruist may employ an agent in the form of government to enforce this supposed moral obligation this is not to say that an ethical altruist will necessarily force this on anyone an altruist may allow others the freedom to behave in a manner they believe to be immoral or selfish in other words their ethical doctrine would not manifest itself politically with regard
those who believe benevolence is a moral obligation altruists may be divided in two broad groups those who believe helping others is
a moral obligation but should not be enforced on individuals and those who believe that since helping others is a moral obligation forcing individuals to help others if they are not willing on their own is justified a prominent example of the former branch of
altruist political thought is lysander spooner who in natural law writes man no doubt owes many other moral duties to his fellow men such as to feed the hungry clothe the naked shelter the homeless
care for the sick protect the defenceless assist the weak and enlighten the ignorant but these are simply moral duties of which each man must be his own judge in each particular case as to whether and how and how far he can or will perform them the latter branch of altruist
political thought on the other hand argues that egoism should
be actively discouraged and that individuals should be forced to help other people thus in politics these altruists almost always take a left wing stance ranging from moderate social democracy to socialism or even communism moderate altruists
of this branch may argue for the creation of taxation funded government programs aimed at benefiting the needy for example transfer payments such as social welfare or public healthcare and public education finally radical altruists of this branch may take things to an extreme and advocate some form of state enforced collectivism communalism or communism this is in line with august comte s philosophy who coined the term altruism which argues against individual
rights finally many believe that helping others or serving society is not a moral obligation at all but that altrusm is an arbitrary pronouncement not philosophically derivable these oppose all government enforced charity individualist anarchist pierre joseph proudhon in one eight four seven warns of enforcing charity that is why charity the prime virtue of the christian the legitimate hope of the socialist the object of all the efforts of the economist
is a social vice the moment it is made a principle of constitution and a law that is why certain economists have been able to say that legal charity had caused more evil in society than proprietary usurpation the philosophy of poverty comte asserts that individual rights are
not compatible with the supposed obligation to serve others some argue that the ethical doctrine if taken to its logical conclusion leads to tyranny altruism and religion all the major world religions promote altruism as a very important moral value christianity and buddhism place particular emphasis on altruistic morality as noted above but judaism islam and hinduism also promote altruistic behavior the good samaritan is a famous new testament parable appearing only in the gospel of luke one zero two five three seven the parable is told by jesus illustrating altruism

nine five four births living people american film directors hulk taiwanese americans taiwanese film directors best director golden globe best director oscar nominees ayn rand march six one nine eight two born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum was best known for her philosophy of objectivism and her novels we the living anthem the fountainhead and atlas shrugged her philosophy and her fiction both emphasize above all the concepts of
individualism rational egoism rational self interest and capitalism which she believed should be implemented fully via laissez faire capitalism her politics has been described as minarchism and libertarianism though she never used the first term and detested the second her novels were based upon the projection of the randian hero a man whose ability and independence causes conflict with the masses but who perseveres nevertheless to achieve his values rand viewed this hero as the ideal and the express goal of her fiction was to showcase such heroes she
believed that man must choose his values and actions by reason that the individual has a right to exist for his own sake neither sacrificing self to others nor others to self and that no one has the right to seek values from others by physical force or impose ideas on others by physical force biography early life rand was born in saint petersburg
russia and was the eldest of three daughters of a jewish family her parents were agnostic and largely non observant from an early age she displayed a strong interest in literature and films she started writing screenplays and novels from the age of seven
her mother taught her french and subscribed to a magazine featuring stories for boys where rand found her first childhood hero cyrus paltons an indian army officer in
a rudyard kipling style story called the mysterious valley throughout her youth she read the novels of sir walter scott alexandre dumas and other romantic writers and expressed a passionate enthusiasm toward the romantic movement as a whole she discovered victor hugo at the age of thirteen and fell deeply in love with his novels later she cited him as her favorite novelist and the greatest novelist of world literature she studied philosophy and history at the university of petrograd her major literary discoveries in university were the works of edmond rostand friedrich schiller and fyodor dostoevsky she admired rostand
for his richly romantic imagination and schiller for his grand heroic scale she admired dostoevsky for his sense of drama and his intense moral judgments but was deeply against his philosophy and his sense of life she continued to write short stories and screenplays and wrote sporadically in her diary which contained intensely anti soviet ideas she also encountered the philosophical ideas of nietzsche
and loved his exaltation of the heroic and independent individual who embraced egoism and rejected altruism in thus spoke zarathustra though an early fan of nietzsche she eventually became critical seeing his philosophy as emphasizing emotion over reason nevertheless as allan gotthelf points out in book on ayn rand the influence was real she did still retain an admiration for some of his ideas and quoted nietzsche in the introduction to the two five th aniversary edition of the fountainhead the noble soul has reverence for
itself her greatest influence by far is aristotle especially organon logic although leonard peikoff promoter of her ideas says she is the greatest philosopher who ever lived she herself considered aristotle the greatest philosopher ever and stated that he was the only philosopher who had influenced her this is probably because as she has stated she did not include her own work when analyzing the culture she then entered the state institute for cinema arts
in one nine two four to study screenwriting in late one nine two five however she was granted a visa to visit american relatives she arrived in the united states in february one nine two six at the age of twenty one after a brief stay with her relatives in chicago she resolved never to return to the soviet union and set out for hollywood to become a screenwriter she then changed her
name to ayn rand there is a story told that she named herself after the remington rand typewriter but she began using the name ayn rand before the typewriter was first sold she stated that her first name ayn was an adaptation of the name of a finnish writer this may have been
the finnish estonian author aino kallas but variations of this name are common in finnish speaking regions major works initially rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses while working as an extra on cecil b demille s king of kings she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor frank o connor who caught her eye the two married in one nine two nine in one nine three one rand became a naturalized citizen of the united states her first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn in
one nine three two to universal studios rand then wrote the play the night of january one six th in one nine three four which was highly successful and published two novels we the living one nine three six and anthem one nine three eight while we the living met with mixed reviews in the u s and positive reviews in the u k anthem received significiant and positive reviews only in england due in part to its odd publication history she was up against
the red decade in america and anthem did not even find a publisher in the united states it was first published in england besides rand had still not perfected her literary style and these novels cannot be considered representative without rand s knowledge or permission we
the living was made into a pair of films noi vivi and addio kira in one nine four two by scalara films rome they were nearly censored by the italian government under benito mussolini but they were permitted because the novel upon which they were based was anti soviet the films were successful and the public easily realized that they were as much against fascism as
communism and the government banned them quickly thereafter these films were re edited into a new version which was approved by rand and re released as we the living in one nine eight six rand s first major professional success came
with her best selling novel the fountainhead one nine four three which she wrote over a period of seven years the novel was rejected by twelve publishers who thought it was too intellectual and opposed to the mainstream of american thought it was finally accepted by the bobbs merrill company publishing house thanks mainly to a member of the editorial board archibald ogden who praised the book in the highest terms and finally prevailed eventually the fountainhead was a worldwide success bringing rand
fame and financial security the theme of the fountainhead is individualism and collectivism in man s soul it features the lives of five main characters the hero howard roark is rand s ideal a noble soul par excellence an architect who is firmly and serenely devoted to his own ideals and believes that no man should copy the style of another in any field especially architecture
all the other characters in the novel demand that he renounce his values but roark maintains his integrity unlike traditional heroes who launch into long and passionate monologues
about their integrity and the unfairness of the world roark in contrast does it with a disdainful almost contemptuous taciturnity and laconicism rand s magnum opus atlas shrugged was published in one nine five
seven becoming an international bestseller atlas shrugged is often seen as rand s most complete statement of the objectivist philosophy in
any of her works of fiction in its appendix she offered this summary my philosophy in essence is the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute the theme of atlas shrugged is the role of man s mind in society rand upheld the
industrialist as one of the most admirable members of any society and fiercely opposed the popular resentment accorded to industrialists this led her to envision a novel wherein the industrialists of america go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway the american economy and its society in general slowly start to collapse the government responds by increasing the already stifling controls on industrial concerns the novel deals with issues as complex and divergent as sex music medicine
politics and human ability along with nathaniel branden his wife barbara and others including alan greenspan and leonard peikoff jokingly designated the collective rand launched the objectivist movement to promote her philosophy
the objectivist movement main article the objectivist movement in one nine five zero rand moved to new york city where in one nine five one she met the young psychology student nathaniel branden who had read her book the fountainhead at the age of one four branden then one nine enjoyed discussing rand s emerging objectivist philosophy with her together branden and some of his other friends formed a group that they dubbed the collective which included some participation by future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan after several years rand and branden s friendly relationship blossomed
into a romantic affair despite the fact that both were married at the time their spouses were both convinced to accept this affair but it eventually led to the separation and then divorce of nathaniel
branden from his wife although one of rand s most strident philosophical points was never to bow to societal pressure or norms ayn rand abandoned her own name see
top of page as did branden born nathan blumenthal throughout the
one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through both her fiction and non fiction works and by giving talks at several east coast universities largely through the nathaniel branden institute the nbi
which branden established to promote her philosophy after a convoluted series of separations rand abruptly ended her relationship with both nathaniel branden and his wife barbara branden in one nine six eight when she learned of nathaniel branden s affair with patrecia scott this later affair did not overlap chronologically with the earlier branden rand affair rand refused to have any further dealings with the nbi she then published a
letter in the objectivist announcing her repudiation of branden for various reasons including dishonesty but did not mention their affair or her role in the schism the two never reconciled and branden remained a persona non grata in the objectivist movement one nine nine nine u s postage stamp honoring rand art by nick gaetano barbara branden presented an account of the breakup of the affair in her book the passion of ayn rand she describes the encounter between nathaniel and rand saying that rand slapped him numerous times and denounced him in
these words if you have an ounce of morality left in you an ounce of psychological health you ll be impotent for the next twenty years and if you achieve any potency you ll know it s a sign of still worse moral degradation conflicts continued in the wake of the break with branden and the subsequent collapse of the nbi many of her closest collective friends began to part ways and during the late seven zero s her activities within the formal objectivist movement began to decline a situation which increased after the
death of her husband in one nine seven nine one of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of atlas shrugged rand died of heart failure on march six one nine eight two in new york city years after having successfully battled cancer and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york grave marker of frank o connor and ayn rand philosophical influences rand rejected virtually all other philosophical schools she acknowledged a shared intellectual lineage with aristotle and john locke and more generally with the philosophies
of the age of enlightenment and the age of reason she occasionally remarked with approval on specific philosophical positions of e g baruch spinoza and thomas aquinas she seems also to have respected the american rationalist brand blanshard however she regarded most philosophers as at best incompetent and at worst downright evil she
singled out immanuel kant as the most influential of the latter sort nonetheless there are connections between rand s views and those of other philosophers she acknowledged that she had been influenced at an early age by the writings of friedrich nietzsche though she later repudiated his thought and reprinted her first novel we the living with some wording changes in one nine
five nine her own thought grew out of critical interaction with it generally her political thought is in the tradition of classical liberalism she expressed qualified enthusiasm for the economic thought of ludwig von mises and henry hazlitt though not mentioned as an influence by
her specifically parallels between her works and ralph waldo emerson s essay self reliance do exist later objectivists such as richard salsman have claimed that rand s economic theories are implicitly more supportive of the doctrines of jean baptiste say though rand herself was likely not acquainted with his work politics and
house committee on un american activities testimony rand s political views were radically pro capitalist
anti statist and anti communist her writings praised above all the human individual and the creative genius of which one is capable she exalted what she saw as the heroic american values of egoism and individualism rand also had a strong dislike for mysticism religion and compulsory charity all of which she believed helped foster a crippling culture of resentment towards individual human happiness
and success rand detested many prominent liberal and conservative politicians of her time even including prominent anti communist crusaders like presidents harry s truman and ronald reagan and senators hubert h humphrey and joseph mccarthy although she argued that mccarthyism
was a myth and that the accusation of mccarthyism was used as an ad hominem argument to discredit anti communists in one nine four seven during the red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the house committee on un american activities see rand s
testimony involved analysis of the one nine four three film song of russia while many
believe that ayn rand disclosed the names of members of the communist party in the u s thus exposing them to blacklisting her testimony consisted entirely of comments regarding the disparity
between her experiences in the soviet union and the fanciful portrayal of it in the film
rand argued that the movie grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the soviet union she told the committee that the film presented life in the ussr as
being much better than it actually was apparently this one nine four three film was intentional wartime propaganda by u s patriots trying to put their soviet allies in world war ii under the best possible light after the huac hearings when ayn rand was asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of their investigations she described the process as futile legacy rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan a six foot floral arrangement in the shape of
a dollar sign was placed near her casket in one nine eight five leonard peikoff a surviving member of the collective and ayn rand s designated heir established the ayn rand institute the center for the advancement of objectivism ari the institute has since registered the name ayn rand as a trademark despite rand s desire that her name never be used to promote the philosophy she developed rand expressed her wish to keep her name and the philosophy of objectivism separate to
ensure the survival of her ideas another schism in the movement occurred in one nine eight nine when objectivist david kelley wrote a question of sanction in which he defended his choice to speak to non objectivist libertarian groups kelley stated that objectivism was not a closed system and should engage with other philosophies peikoff in an article for the intellectual activist called
fact and value argued that objectivism is indeed a closed system and that truth and moral goodness are directly related peikoff expelled kelley from his movement whereupon kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the objectivist center rand and objectivism are less well
known outside north america although there are pockets of interest in europe and australia and her novels are reported to be popular in india and to be gaining an increasingly wider audience in africa her work has had little effect on academic philosophy for her followers are with some notable exceptions drawn from the non academic world neil peart the drummer and lyricist with the canadian progressive rock band rush was influenced by rand philosophy during the early years of the
band the most notable instances of this are the track anthem from the album fly by night one nine seven five and the title
track from the album two one one two one nine seven six controversy rand s views are controversial religious and socially conservative thinkers have criticized her atheism many adherents and practitioners of continental philosophy criticize her celebration of rationality and self interest within the dominant philosophical movement in the english speaking world analytic philosophy rand s work has been mostly ignored no leading research university in this tradition considers rand or objectivism to be an important philosophical specialty or research area as is documented by brian leiter s
report some academics however are trying to bring rand s work into the mainstream for instance the ayn rand society founded in one nine eight seven is affiliated with the american philosophical association in two zero zero six cambridge university press will publish a volume on rand
s ethical theory written by ari affiliated scholar tara smith a notable
exception to the general lack of attention paid to rand is the essay on the randian argument by harvard university philosopher robert nozick which appears in his collection socratic puzzles nozick s own libertarian political conclusions are similar to rand s but his essay criticizes her foundational argument in ethics which claims that one s own life is for each individual the only ultimate value because
it makes all other values possible to make this argument sound nozick argues that rand still needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer the state of eventually dying and having no values thus he argues her attempt to deduce the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of assuming the conclusion or begging the question and that her solution to david hume s famous is ought problem
is unsatisfactory nevertheless nozick respected rand as an author and noted that he found her books enjoyable and thought provoking rand has sometimes been viewed with suspicion for her practice of presenting her philosophy in fiction and non fiction books aimed at a general audience rather than publishing in peer reviewed journals rand s defenders note that she is part of a long tradition of authors who wrote philosophically rich fiction including dante john milton fyodor dostoevsky and albert camus and that
other philosophers such as jean paul sartre presented their philosophies in both fictional and non fictional forms other critics argue that rand s idealistic philosophy and her romantic literary style are not applicable to the inhabited world in particular these critics claim that rand s novels are made up of unrealistic and one dimensional characters they criticize the portrayal of the objectivist heroes as incredibly intelligent unencumbered by doubt
wealthy and free of flaws in contrast to the frequent portrayal of the antagonists as weak pathetic full of uncertainty and lacking in imagination and talent defenders of rand point out counterexamples to these criticisms neither eddie willers nor cherryl taggart both positive characters is especially gifted or intelligent but both are characters of dignity and respect leo kovalensky suffers enormously due to his inability to cope with the brutality and banality of communism andrei taganov dies after realizing his philosophical errors dominique francon is initially bitterly unhappy because she believes evil is powerful hank rearden
is torn by inner emotional conflict brought on by a philosophical contradiction and dagny taggart thinks that she alone is capable of saving the world two of her main protagonists howard roark and john galt did not begin life
wealthy though rand believed that under capitalism valuable contributions will routinely be rewarded by wealth she certainly did not think that wealth made a
person virtuous in fact she presents many vicious bureaucrats and waspish elitists who use statism to accumulate money and power moreover hank rearden is exploited because of his social na vet as for the purportedly weak and pathetic villains rand s defenders point out that ellsworth toohey
is represented as being a great strategist and communicator from an early age and dr robert stadler is a brilliant scientist rand herself replied to these literary criticisms and in advance of much of them with her essay the goal of my writing one nine six three there and in other essays collected in her book the romantic manifesto
a philosophy of literature two nd rev ed one nine seven five rand makes it clear that her goal is to project her vision of an ideal man not man as he is but man as he might and ought to be rand s views on sex have also led to some controversy according to her for a woman qua woman the essence of femininity is hero worship the desire to look up to man one nine six eight some in the bdsm community see her work as relevant and supportive particularly the fountainhead another
source of controversy is rand s view that homosexuality is immoral and disgusting as well as her support for the right of businesses to discriminate on the basis of homosexuality such as in their hiring practices specifically she stated that there is a psychological
immorality at the root of homosexuality because it involves psychological flaws corruptions errors or unfortunate premises on the
topic of non governmental discrimination rand s defenders argue that her support for its legality was motivated by holding property rights above civil or human rights as she did not believe that human rights were distinct
from property rights so it did not constitute an endorsement of the morality of the prejudice itself
in support of this they cite rand s opposition to some prejudices though not homophobia on moral grounds in essays like racism and global balkanization while still arguing for the right of individuals and businesses to act on such prejudice

time of french rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of artesian wells in districts which only required water to make them fertile of the crops raised
wheat barley and oats are the principal cereals a great variety of vegetables and of fruits especially citrus products is exported a considerable amount of cotton was grown at the time of the united states civil war but the industry declined afterwards in the early years of the two zero th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed a small amount of cotton is
also grown in the southern oases large quantities of crin vegetal vegetable horse hair an excellent fibre are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm the olive both for its fruit and petroleum and tobacco are cultivated with great success algeria also exports figs dates esparto grass and cork wine production throughout algeria
the soil favours the growth of vines the country in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the french government can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste the growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists but it was not until vineyards in france were attacked by phylloxera that the export of wine from algeria became significant in one eight eight three despite precautionary measures algerian vineyards were
also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved in one eight five zero less than two zero zero zero acres eight km were devoted to the grape but in one eight seven eight this had increased to over four two zero zero zero acres
one seven zero km which yielded seven four three six zero zero zero gallons two eight zero zero zero m of wine despite bad seasons and ravages of insects cultivation extended and in one eight nine five the vineyards covered three zero zero zero zero zero acres one two zero zero km the produce being eight eight zero zero zero zero zero zero gallons three three three zero zero zero m the area of cultivation in one nine zero five exceeded four zero zero zero zero zero acres one six zero zero km and in that year the amount
of wine produced was one five seven zero zero zero zero zero zero gallons five nine four zero zero zero m by that time the

is derived from the name of the city of algiers from the arabic word al jaz ir which translates
as the islands referring to the four islands which lay off that city s coast until becoming part of the mainland in one five two five history algeria has been inhabited by berbers or amazigh since at least one zero

zero bc as the western roman empire collapsed the berbers became independent again in much of the area while the vandals took over parts until later expelled by the generals of the byzantine emperor justinian i the byzantine empire then retained a precarious grip on the
east of the country until the coming of the arabs in the eight th century roman arch of trajan at thamugadi timgad algeria after some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as kusayla and kahina the berbers adopted islam en masse but almost immediately expelled the caliphate from algeria establishing an ibadi state under the rustamids having converted the kutama of kabylie to its cause the shia fatimids overthrew the rustamids and conquered egypt they left algeria
and tunisia to their zirid vassals when the latter rebelled and adopted sunnism they sent in a populous arab tribe
the banu hilal to weaken them thus incidentally initiating the arabization of the countryside the almoravids and almohads berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers brought a period of relative peace and development however with the almohads collapse algeria became
a battleground for their three successor states the algerian zayyanids tunisian hafsids and moroccan merinids in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries spain started attacking and taking over many coastal cities prompting some to seek help from the ottoman empire algeria was brought into the ottoman empire by khair ad din and his brother aruj who established algeria s modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the corsairs their privateering peaked
in algiers in the one six zero zero s piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the first and second barbary war with
the united states on the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded algiers in one eight three zero however intense resistance from such personalities as emir abdelkader
ahmed bey and fatma n soumer made for a slow conquest of algeria not technically completed until the early one nine zero zero s when the last tuareg were conquered constantine algeria one eight four zero meanwhile however the french suppressed slavery and made algeria an integral part of france a status that would end only with the collapse of
the fourth republic tens of thousands of settlers from france italy spain and malta moved in to farm the algerian coastal
plain and occupy the most prized parts of algeria s cities benefiting from the french government s confiscation of communally held land people of european descent in algeria the so called pieds noirs as well as the native algerian jews were full french citizens starting from the end of the one nine th century by contrast the vast majority of muslim algerians even veterans of the french army remained outside of french law possessing neither french citizenship nor the right to vote algeria s social fabric was stretched to breaking point
during this period literacy dropped massively while land confiscation uprooted much of the population in one nine five four the national liberation front fln launched the
guerrilla algerian war of independence after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare they succeeded in pushing france out in one nine six two most of the one zero two five zero zero zero pieds noirs as well as nine one zero zero zero harkis pro french muslim algerians serving in the french army together forming about one zero of the population of algeria in one nine six two fled
algeria for france in just a few months in the middle of that year the battle of algiers is a movie about the algerian war of independence algeria s first president the fln leader ahmed ben bella was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister houari boum di nne in one nine six five under ben bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial and
this trend continued throughout boumedienne s government however boumedienne relied much more heavily on the army and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role agriculture was collectivised and a massive industrialization drive launched oil extraction facilities were nationalized and this increased the state s wealth especially after the one nine seven three oil crisis but the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil bringing hardship when the price collapsed in the one nine eight zero s
in foreign policy algeria was a member and leader of the non aligned nations a dispute with morocco over the western sahara nearly led to war dissent was rarely tolerated and the state s control over the media and the outlawing of political parties other than the fln was cemented in the repressive constitution of one nine seven six boum dienne died in one nine seven eight but the rule of his successor chadli bendjedid
was little more open the state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread the modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to algeria village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased new industries emerged agriculture was substantially reduced and
education a rarity in colonial times was extended nationwide raising the literacy rate from less than one zero to over six zero improvements in healthcare led to a dramatic increase in the birthrate seven eight children per mother which had two consequences a very youthful population and a housing
crisis the new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed left wingers including berber identity movements and islamic int gristes both protested against one party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the one nine eight zero s mass protests from both camps in autumn one nine eight eight forced benjedid to concede the end of one party rule and elections were announced for one nine nine one in december one nine nine
one the islamic salvation front won the first round of the country s first multiparty elections the military then canceled the second round forced then president bendjedid to resign and banned the islamic salvation front the ensuing conflict engulfed algeria in the violent algerian civil war more than one zero zero zero zero zero
people were killed often in unprovoked massacres of civilians the question of who was responsible for these massacres remains controversial
among academic observers many were claimed by the armed islamic group after one nine nine eight the war waned and by two zero zero two the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered taking advantage of an amnesty program though sporadic fighting continued in some areas elections resumed in
one nine nine five and in one nine nine nine after a series of short term leaders representing the military abdelaziz bouteflika the current president was elected the issue of berber language and identity increased in significance particularly after the extensive kabyle protests of two zero zero one and the near total boycott of local elections in kabylie the government responded with concessions including naming of tamazight berber as a national language and teaching it in schools politics the head of
state is the president of the republic who is elected to a five year term renewable once algeria has universal suffrage the president is the head of the council of ministers and of the high security council he
appoints the prime minister who is also the head of government the prime minister appoints
the council of ministers the algerian parliament is bicameral consisting of a lower chamber the national people s assembly apn with three eight zero members and an upper chamber the council of nation with one four four members the apn is elected every five years throughout the
one nine six zero s algeria supported many independence movements in sub saharan africa and was a leader in the non aligned movement while it shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring morocco the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other since algeria s independence this is due to two reasons morocco
s claim to portions of western algeria which led to the sand war in one nine six three and algeria s support for the polisario an armed group of sahrawi refugees seeking independence for the moroccan ruled western sahara which it hosts within its borders in the city of tindouf tensions between algeria and morocco as well as issues relating to the algerian civil war have
put great obstacles in the way of tightening the maghreb arab union nominally established in one nine eight nine but with little practical weight with its coastal neighbors provinces algeria is divided into four eight wilayas provinces geography map of algeria with cities the hoggar mountains most of the coastal area is
hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are few good harbours the area just south of the coast known as the tell is fertile further south is the atlas mountain range and the sahara desert algiers oran and constantine are the main cities algeria s climate is arid and hot although the coastal climate is mild and the winters in the mountainous areas can be severe algeria is prone to sirocco a hot dust

million remain nomadic or partly nomadic ninety nine percent of the population is classified ethnically as arab berber and religiously as muslim other religions are restricted to extremely small groups mainly of foreigners europeans account for less than one most algerians are arab by language and identity and of mixed berber arab ancestry the berbers inhabited algeria before the arrival of arab tribes during the expansion of islam in the seven th century the issue of ethnicity and language is sensitive after
many years of government marginalization of berber or amazigh as
some prefer culture today the arab berber issue is often a case of self identification or identification through language and culture rather than
a racial or ethnic distinction the two zero or so of the population who self identify as berbers and primarily speak berber languages such as tamazight are divided into several ethnic groups notably kabyle the largest in the mountainous north central area chaoui in the eastern atlas mountains mozabites in the m zab valley and tuareg in the far south language the official language is arabic spoken natively
in dialectal form darja by some eight zero of the population the other two zero or so speak berber tamazight officially a national language
french is the most widely studied foreign language distantly followed by english but is very rare as a native language since independence the government has pursued a policy of linguistic arabization of education and bureaucracy with some success although many university courses continue to be taught in french culture mosque in algiers modern algerian

rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with francisco d anconia who does know the secret and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in galt s speech second rearden is used to illustrate rand s theory of sex lillian rearden cannot appreciate hank rearden s virtues and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex dagny taggart clearly does appreciate rearden s virtues
and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire rearden is torn by a
contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct while responding sexually to dagny who represents his highest values rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates
rand s sexual theory rearden appears in sections one two one one three two one four seven and one six one and is mentioned in sections one one four and one three one hugh akston identified as one of the last
great advocates of reason he was a renowned philosopher and the head of the department of philosophy at patrick henry university where he taught francisco d anconia john galt and ragnar danneskj ld he was along with robert stadler a father figure to these three akston s name is so hallowed that a young lady on hearing that francisco
had studied under him is shocked she thought he must have
been one of those great names from an earlier century hugh akston is mentioned in section one six one james taggart the president of taggart transcontinental and a leader of the looters taggart is an expert influence peddler who is incapable of making decisions on his own he relies on his sister dagny taggart to actually run the railroad but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor in a sense he is the antithesis of dagny as the
novel progresses the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed it is a code of nihilism the goal of this code is to not exist to become a zero taggart struggles to remain unaware that
this is his goal he maintains his pretence that he wants to live
and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about
himself this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends and the horror that he will succeed at this james taggart appears in sections one one one one one four one three one one three two one four three one four four one five two and one six one and is mentioned in sections one four six and one four eight john galt the question who is john galt
is asked repeatedly throughout atlas shrugged late into the book we learn that john galt is the man who stopped the motor of the world and the leader of the strikers he is also the same character as the mystery worker the son of an ohio garage mechanic galt left home at age one two and began college at patrick henry university at age one six there he befriended francisco d anconia and ragnar danneskj ld all three of whom double majored in physics and philosophy they were
the cherished students of the brilliant scientist robert stadler and the brilliant philosopher hugh akston after graduating galt became an engineer at the twentieth century motor works where he designed a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity with the potential to change the world like ellis wyatt he has created what
many had for years said was impossible when the company owners decided to run the factory by the collectivist maxim by each according to his ability to each according to his need galt organized a successful labor strike proclaiming his promise to stop the motor of the world he began traversing the globe meeting the world s most successful businessmen systematically convincing them to follow in his footsteps one by one they began abandoning their business empires which galt convinced them were doomed to failure anyhow given
the increased nationalization of industry by the government secretly these captains of industry led by galt and banker midas mulligan had created their own society a secret enclave of rational individualists living in galt s gulch a town secluded high in a wilderness of mountains dagny accidentally finds the town and a shocked john galt by crash landing
a light aircraft while pursuing quentin daniels since everyone across the country is repeating the phrase who is john galt it is natural that many people have attempted to answer that question the phrase becomes an expression of helplessness and despair at the current state of the world dagny taggart hears a number of john galt legends before finding the real john galt and eventually joining his cause and learning that all of the stories have an element of truth to them there
is a clothing store in vail colorado called john galt ltd one presumes that on occasion a customer unknowingly walks in and asks who is john galt lillian rearden the wildly unsupportive wife of hank rearden they have been married eight years as the novel begins lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband she compares being rearden s wife with owning the world s most powerful horse since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast she
must bridle it down to her level even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be greviously wasted lillian also serves to illustrate rand s theory of sex she believes sex is a base animal instinct and that sexual indulgence is a sign of moral weakness she is incapable of feeling this kind of desire which she believes
testifies to her moral superiority however according to the theory of sex lillian s lack of sexual capacity results
from her inability to experience value in herself she is therefore unable to respond sexually when she experiences value in others lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is realistic enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts in section one six one she indicates that she abhors francisco d anconia because she believes he is a sexual adventurer lillian rearden appears in sections one two one and one six one the looters a group of evil characters sometimes

produce switches made of rearden metal he is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology and has to be ridden and cajoled before he is willing to accept the contract when pressured by public opinion he discontinues production of the switches forcing dagny to find an alternative source mr mowen appears in section one seven one mystery worker a menial worker for taggart transcontinental who often dines with eddie

are no new brands and the old brands are all disappearing he examines a cigarette given to dagny by hugh akston but it is a new brand that he has never seen before it carries the sign of the dollar in his first appearance the newsstand owner likens the fire of a cigarette to the fire of the mind this alludes to the greek myth of prometheus who gave mankind the
gift of fire allowing it to raise itself up and become civilized in atlas shrugged it is the mind of man
that raises mankind thus the cigarettes become symbolic of the men of the mind the disappearance of the old brands represents the disappearance of the men of the mind and the newsstand owner s discovery of the new brand foreshadows dagny s discovery of a new kind of men of the mind orren boyle the head of associated steel and a friend of james

based on his need for money and the fact of familial ties philip rearden appears in sections one two one and one six one quentin daniels an enterprising engineer hired by dagny taggart to reconstruct john galt s motor partway through this process quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons john galt himself had dagny sets out to meet quentin in hopes of convincing him

crude reductionist who believes man is nothing but a collection of chemicals he believes there are no standards that definitions are fluid reason is a superstition that it is futile to seek meaning in life and that the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood he explains all this in his book the metaphysical contradictions of the universe and at cocktail parties dr pritchett appears in section one six one the strikers people of the mind who go on strike

states though he s never specifically referred to as such in the world of atlas shrugged all presidents and prime ministers are referred to simply as head of the state and mr this is because countries have been standardized as people s states which seem to share a common form of government thomspon s title can thus be seen as reflecting the fact
that the us is in the process of evolving into one of these people s states one of the looters he s not particularly intelligent and has
a very undistinguished look he knows politics however and is a master of public relations and back room deals rand s notes indicate that she modelled him on president harry s truman wesley mouch a member of the looters and at the beginning of the storyline the incompetent lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington initially wesley mouch is the least powerful and least significant of the looters the other members of this group feel they
can look down upon him with impunity eventually he becomes the most
powerful looter and the country s economic dictator thereby illustrating rand s belief that a government run economy places too much power in the hands of incompetent bureaucrats who would never have positions of similar influence in a private sector business wesley mouch appears in section one three one and is mentioned in section one six one see also minor characters in atlas shrugged atlas shrugged lists of fictional characters technology in atlas shrugged ayn rand s novel includes a variety

galt s booby trapped laboratory without causing collateral structural damage though rand describes it as turning static electricity into useful mechanical work its operation is more reminiscent of modern speculation about zero point energy dagny discovers a discarded prototype of the motor and it is superficially described in section part one chapter nine galt shows dagny the motor and describes it in section part three chapter one atlas shrugged fictional technology companies in atlas shrugged the ayn rand novel generally are divided into two groups these

two and one seven one atlas shrugged fictional companies some of the important concepts discussed in atlas shrugged include the sanction of the victim and the theory of sex sanction of the victim the sanction of the victim is defined as the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil to accept the role of sacrificial victim
for the sin of creating values the entire story of atlas shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question what would happen if this sanction was revoked when atlas shrugs relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world he is revoking his sanction the concept is supposedly original in the thinking of ayn rand and is foundational to her moral theory she holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it to quote from galt s speech evil is impotent and has
no power but that which we let it extort from us and i saw that evil was impotent and the only weapon of
its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood rand claims in adhering to this concept rand assigns virtue to the trait of selfishness throughout atlas shrugged numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world but they cannot put their finger on what it is the concept they cannot grasp is the sanction of the victim the first person to grasp the concept
is john galt who vows to stop the motor of the world by getting the creators of the world to withhold their sanction we first glimpse the concept in section one two one when hank rearden feels he is duty bound to support his family despite their hostility towards him in section one four six the principle is stated explicitly by dan conway i suppose somebody s got to be sacrificed if it turned out to be
me i have no right to complain theory of sex in rejecting the traditional christian altruist moral code rand also rejects the sexual code that in her view is a logical implication of altruism rand introduces a theory of sex in atlas shrugged which is purportedly implied by her broader ethical and psychological theories far from being a debasing animal instinct sex is the highest celebration of our greatest values sex is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only
be experienced in the abstract one is sexually attracted to those who embody one s values those who have base values will be attracted to baseness to those who
also have ignoble values those who lack any clear purpose will find sex devoid of meaning people of high values will respond sexually to those
who embody high values that our sexual desire is a response to the embodiment of our values in others is a radical and original theory however even those who are sympathetic to this theory have criticized it as being incomplete for instance since according to rand the economy is also such an expression of values and since it is always possible to encounter someone who embodies one s values more completely this
would seem to make family undesirable indeed rand treats family as a sort of trap furthermore promiscuity prostitution and an endless round robin of values driven sexual
relationships would become inevitable from this viewpoint one could say that aldous huxley portrayed the ideal sexual state brave new world features humans who are incapable of deviating from their caste oriented values which naturally include a code of sexual desirability her sexual theory is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of hank rearden with lillian rearden and dagny taggart and later with dagny taggart and john galt other important illustrations of this theory are found in section
one five two recounts dagny s relationship with francisco d anconia section one six one recounts hank and lillian rearden s courtship and lillian s attitude towards sex atlas shrugged this is a list of general items in ayn rand s atlas shrugged anti dog eat dog rule the anti dog eat dog rule is passed by the national alliance of railroads in section one four five allegedly to prevent destructive competition between railroads the rule gives the
alliance the authority to forbid competition between railroads in certain parts of the country it was crafted by orren boyle as a favor for james taggart with the purpose of driving the phoenix durango out of colorado bracelet the very first thing made from rearden metal is a bracelet the bracelet is used to illustrate rand s theory of sex the bracelet symbolizes the value created by hank rearden s long struggle to invent rearden
metal when he gives it to lillian rearden as a present in section one two one she says it s fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails however lillian fully grasps the significance of the gift her snide remark is her way of denigrating her husband s ethos in section one six one lillian wears this bracelet at a party thrown on her anniversary she makes fun of it all night long and
when dagny taggart hears lillian say she would gladly trade it for a common diamond bracelet dagny takes her up on
it lillian later asks for it back upon realizing her power over her husband was slowly diminishing dagny denies the offer the bracelet appears in sections one two one and one six one cub club a night club in new york when francisco d anconia returns to new york in section one four one he explains he came because of a hat check girl at the cub club and the liverwurst at moe s delicatessen on third avenue equalization of opportunity bill a bill designed by the looters that proposes to limit

needs to run his steel mills the looters claim the bill is meant to give a chance to the little guy the equalization of opportunity bill is appears in section one six one galt s gulch a secluded refuge in a valley of colorado where the men of ability have retreated after relinquishing participation in american society nicknamed galt s gulch by its inhabitants it is in fact the property of midas mulligan one of the early strikers to follow
john galt s call this call was to the great men of mind and action
to abandon the increasingly slave state inclinations of a decaying united states to go
on strike thereby withdrawing the only thing supporting the parasites and looters sarcastically nicknamed midas in the press because everything he seemed to touch turned to gold mulligan adopted the nickname during his explosive investment career before dropping out of sight he had purchased this land among his far ranging speculative endeavors and subsequently retreated to it upon his disappearance other strikers soon followed him there including john galt renting or buying
land for summer retreats as a respite from continuing their search for fellow strikers among the increasingly collapsing american society eventually a society develops in galt s gulch as more people live there year round as the outside world becomes virtually unsafe to visit we are introduced to galt s gulch in the final section of the novel
in the first chapter entitled atlantis the people live with each other in completely free society and embody everything which is the thesis of the novel the appropriate values for a society of mankind philosophical moral economic legal aesthetic and sexual among others too numerous to mention we find industrious ambitious happy people continuing their chosen fields of endeavor without the yokes of any taxation or regulation
conversely there is a reverence for private property everything transacted is paid for with the re invented currency of solid gold coin struck from the reserves of midas mulligan s bank which now resides in the valley the townspeople receive services from the various heroes we have met throughout
the novel who all now reside and produce in the valley they purchase power inexpensively from galt and his invention of the static electricity motor maintain their anonymity from the
outside world via galt s invention of the air wave reflection device giving the view from above the camouflage of reflected images of
other mountainsides nearby and some attend galt s lectures on physics where he explains his discoveries on new fundamental laws and applied mathematics the people purchase medical treatment from the care of dr hendricks who uses his invention of a portable x ray machine to initially diagnose dagny taggart upon her crash landing into the valley attend concerts of new musical compositions of richard halley who has continued to compose
in the valley acquire raw materials from the efforts of francisco d anconia s excavations around the valley attend philosophy lectures from the now retired pirate ragnar danneskj ld receive loans from midas mulligan etc rand s description of galt

hears an unfamiliar theme being whistled by a brakeman on the taggart comet she asks him what it is he responds halley s fifth concerto when dagny says halley only wrote four concertos the brakeman says he made a mistake and

true at least symbolically legend one section one six one a spinster at lillian rearden s party tells dagny the story john galt was a man of inestimable wealth who found the sunken island of atlantis while fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world the sight was so beautiful that having seen it he could never go back to the world so he sank his ship
and took his fortune down with him the actual john galt was a man who created something of inestimable value a new motor and who discovered the secret to what was wrong with the world while fighting the most evil social philosophy ever put into practice the world he envisioned was so beautiful that he refused to live in the world that was and disappeared taking the secret of
motor with him atlantis the isles of the blessed is a place where no
one could enter except those who had the spirit of a hero described in these terms it is the same as galt s gulch moe s delicatessen a delicatessen in new york when francisco d anconia returns to new york in section one four one he explains he came because of a hat check girl at the cub club and the liverwurst at moe s delicatessen on third avenue national alliance of railroads an industry group formed to promote the welfare of the industry as a whole requiring members

developed by francisco d anconia and attracted significant investments from james taggart and orren boyle who assumed francisco could be counted on to deliver a winner the san sebastian line is nationalized by the mexican government soon after completion when it is nationalized in section one four two it is referred to as the san sebastian railroad it is
mentioned in sections one one four one three one one three two one three three one four two one four three and one five two san sebastian mines san sebastian mines is a copper mining project in mexico founded by francisco d anconia and named after his ancestor sebastian d anconia francisco s reputation as a businessman is so great that investors flock to him begging to invest money in the enterprise investors include james taggart and orren boyle taggart goes so far as to build a new branch of taggart
transcontinental the san sebastian line to serve the mines sinking three zero million into the project when the development of the mines appears complete the mexican government nationalizes them as well as
the san sebastian line only to discover there is no copper and there never was when taggart tells francisco he considers the mines a rotten swindle section one six one
francisco explains that taggart should be pleased with the way he ran the mines he says he put into practice those moral precepts that were accepted around the world the
world says it is evil to pursue a profit he got no profit from the worthless mines the world says the purpose of an enterprise is not to produce but to give a livelihood to its employees it produced nothing but created jobs that would never have existed if one was only concerned with developing a real mine the
world says the owner is an exploiter and the workers do all the real work he left the enterprise entirely in the hands of the workers and did not burden anyone with his presence the world says need is more important than ability he hired a mining specialist
who needed a job very badly but had no ability in short the san sebastian mines were an illustration of what happens when this moral code is put into practice and a warning of what will soon
happen to the world as a whole the san sebastian mines appear in sections one one one one three one one three two one four two one five one one five two and one six one taggart building a skyscraper in new york the headquarters of taggart transcontinental and the location of the taggart terminal taggart comet the taggart comet is taggart transcontinental s flagship train it runs from new york to san francisco and has never been late the taggart comet appears in sections one one two one one three and

on his shoulders but in the greek myths the titan atlas stands on the earth and holds up the sky in the statues that represent atlas the big round thing on his back represents the heavens which because of the apparent circular motion of the planets
around the earth were conceived of as being round some tellings of the atlas myth have him carrying both the earth and the heavens on his back
but this appears to be a modern retelling further research might confirm this character names some of the character names are or appear
to be puns or have some other significance see also characters in atlas shrugged when asked why so many of her names have syllables with many hard consonants like dag tag den stad rand said that
she just liked those sounds ragnar danneskjold sounds like dane s gold a tribute paid by the medieval english to the vikings to bribe them into being peaceful however note skjold means shield not gold however the hero of victor hugo s first novel hans of iceland becomes the first of the counts of danneskj ld in the one nine seven zero s rand told marsha familaro
enright that her use of this name was not plagiarism because there really were counts of danneskj ld robert stadler sounds like the german word for state staat dr stadler is a statist in that he believes it appropriate
and necessary for the state to fund scientific research francisco d anconia rand s husband was frank o connor john galt the name of a one nine th century scottish novelist though this is apparently coincidental galt is close to geld and gold the name was probably used because it had to be such that it could become proverbial this would not be possible with a long awkward name wesley mouch mouch is exactly what his name sounds like a mooch he has
no real virtue or skill but somehow becomes a powerful figure crime common street crime is conspicuously absent in atlas shrugged characters walk the streets with no thought
of being mugged or attacked historical figures and events atlas shrugged takes place in a world with a different history from our own but there are some historical figures and events that are mentioned aristotle section one five two francisco d anconia wrote a thesis on the influence of aristotle s theory of the immovable mover dark ages section one six one ragnar danneskjold s piracy is likened to something out of the dark ages inquisition section one five two sebastian d anconia flees spain to escape persecution under the inquisition middle ages section
one six one it is said that ragnar danneskjold hides in the norwegian fjords as the vikings did in the middle ages nero section one five two francisco d anconia compares himself to the emperor nero patrick henry section one five two the eponym of patrick henry university vikings section one six one it is said that ragnar danneskjold hides in the norwegian fjords as the vikings did in the middle ages humor in section one five two francisco cracks that the mexican government was promising a roast of pork
every sunday for every man woman child and abortion in section one five two francisco lists the various buildings constructed for the workers of the san sebastian mines and notes
how they are all poorly built and can be expected to collapse except for the church the church i think will stand they ll need it he quips since the other things are things of value houses roads etc it is ironic that only the church was built to last to rand and her heroes a church is of no real value almost every nation in the world except the united states is referred to as the people s state of and they are
all apparently the recipients of relief supplies from the united states in conversation people casually refer to them as the people s state of rather than just say france or norway it is obvious that people would not refer to countries by their formal names in casual conversation we don t call canada the dominion of canada or germany the federal republic of germany so by having her characters do this rand is exercising her dry wit lying the sympathetic characters of atlas shrugged generally do not tell lies with the following
exceptions even when they are clearly trying to conceal something they do not rely on overt falsehood even when it is obvious that they could do so without being found out in section one one two brakeman tells dagny taggart he does not recall the name of the song he was whistling or where he heard it in section one four one francisco d anconia tells
the press he came to new york because of a hat check girl and the liverwurst at moe s delicatessen in section one five one we learn dagny taggart once lied to her mother about a cut to her lip that francisco had given her this was the only lie she ever told in section one five two dagny taggart asks francisco if richard halley has written a fifth concerto
he is evasive and tells her that halley has stopped writing is this a lie in section one six one hank rearden tells dagny that he was the one who invited bertram scudder to the rearden s anniversary party it was actually lillian who invited him and rearden had been furious about
it in part two chapter nine eddie willers tells dagny taggart that his hesitation and uncertainty is caused by the illegality of her directions in fact eddie was shocked by the evidence and thus realization of her affair with hank rearden people s states almost every nation that is mentioned other than the united states is referred to as a people s
state these include the people s state of england the people s state of france the people s state of india the people s state of mexico the people s state of norway the people s state of portugal the people s state of turkey the leaders of these countries are given the title the head of the people s state and called mr or senor the president of the united states is refered to as mr thompson and called the head of the state which seems to imply the us is on its way to becoming a people
s state as well religion in section one five two francisco tells dagny he named the san sebastian mines
after his ancestor sebastian d anconia a man they both honor deeply this to dagny is
blasphemy the only kind of blasphemy she understands social classes rand is sometimes called an elitist this claim is probably accurate if we allow for the fact that rand had her own standard of eliteness throughout atlas shrugged virtue is equated with creative ability it is however worth noting that in atlas shrugged there are no characters with creative ability which do not function as author surrogate characters most notably dagny taggart conversely all of the characters which disagree with the author are unintelligent and creatively bankrupt and usually actively destructive compare
to the real world where scientists inventors artists and industrialists often have wildly varying and strongly conflicting desires and opinions different social classes are represented among both the heroes and the villains of atlas shrugged among the heroes john galt and hank rearden
are from working class backgrounds while dagny taggart and francisco d anconia are from wealthy families among the villains fred kinnan is from a working class background while james taggart and betty pope are from wealthy families atlas shrugged atlas shrugged cover by nick gaetano atlas shrugged is a novel by russian born writer and philosopher ayn rand first published in one nine five seven in the usa and rand s last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy most regard atlas shrugged as rand s most famous work her tour de force and most objectivists
hold it to be objectively as in factually the greatest novel of all time its theme as stated by rand is the importance of the individual s reasoning mind in human life it is a highly philosophical and allegorical story that deals with themes of rand s own objectivism though she was not yet known as a philosopher when it was
written whether or not she had philosophical intentions and to what extent or sense the novel is an allegory are controversial subjects in fact the ideas behind the book and their extremism as well as its relative popularity have made
it one of the most controversial novels of the two zero th century it is also one of the longest
novels ever written totaling one thousand pages or more depending on the publication philosophy and writing the theme of atlas shrugged is that independent rational thought is the motor that powers the world in the book men of the mind go on strike
allowing the collapse of what only they hold together a peaceful cohesiveness rand claims that humans particularly those whose
productive work comes from mental effort may create wherever forceful human interference is absent given no alternative they remove themselves from the looters the title is an analogy the rational men like the greek god atlas hold the world on their shoulders in the form of a strike they have chosen to shrug the book is rooted in objectivism the philosophical system founded by rand rand suggests that society stagnates when independence and individual achievement are
discouraged or demonized and that inversely a society will become more prosperous as it allows encourages and rewards independence and individual achievement rand believed that independence flourishes to the extent that people are free and that achievement is rewarded best when private property is
respected strictly she advocated laissez faire capitalism as the political system that is most
consistent with these beliefs these considerations make atlas shrugged a highly political book especially in its portrayal of fascism socialism and communism or indeed any form of state intervention in societal affairs as fatally flawed however rand claimed that it is not a fundamentally political book but
that the politics portrayed in the novel are a result of her attempt to display her image of the ideal man and the position of the human
mind in society rand argues that independence and individual achievement drive the world and should be embraced her worldview requires a rational moral code she disputes the notion that self sacrifice is a virtue and is similarly dismissive of human faith in a god or higher being the book positions itself against christianity specifically often directly within the characters dialogue setting exactly when atlas shrugged is meant to take
place is kept deliberately vague in section one five two the population of
new york city is given as seven million the historical new york city reached seven million people in the one nine three zero s which might place the novel sometime after that there are many
early two zero th century technologies available but the political situation is clearly different from actual history one interpretation is that the novel takes place a hundred or perhaps hundreds of years in the future implying that since the world lapsed into its socialistic morass a global wide stagnation has occurred in technological growth population growth and indeed growth
of any kind the wars economic depressions and other events of the two zero th century would be a distant memory to all but scholars and academicians this would be in line with rand s ideas and commentary on other novels depicting utopian and dystopian societies furthermore this is also in line with an excerpt
from a one nine six four interview with playboy magazine in which rand states what we have today is not a capitalist society but a mixed economy that is a mixture of freedom and controls which by the presently dominant trend is moving toward dictatorship the action in atlas shrugged takes place at a time when society has reached the stage of dictatorship when and if this happens that will be the time to go on strike but not until then thus implying that her novel takes place at some point in the future
the concept of societal stagnation in the wake of collectivist systems is central to the plot of another of rand
s works anthem all countries outside the us have become or become during the novel people s states there are many examples of early two zero th century technology in atlas shrugged but no post war advances such as nuclear weapons helicopters or computers jet planes are mentioned briefly as being a relatively new technology television is a novelty that has yet to assume any cultural significance while radio broadcasts are prominent though rand does not use
in the book many of the technological innovations available while she was writing she introduces some advanced fictional inventions e g sound based weapons of mass destruction torture devices as well as power plants most of the action in atlas shrugged occurs in the united states however there are important events around the world such as in the people s states of mexico chile and argentina and piracy at sea plot a section by section analysis of atlas shrugged is available on wikibooks the novel s plot split into three sections though the story is coherent apart from
these is extremely complex the first two sections and to some extent the last follow dagny taggart a no nonsense railroad executive and her attempt to keep the company alive despite the fact that
society is falling towards collectivism altruism statism all throughout the novel people repeat a platitude dagny greatly resents who is john galt it is a reflection of their helplessness as the saying means don t ask important questions because they don t have answers the geniuses of the world seem
to be disappearing and the apparent decline of civilization is making it more and more difficult for her to sustain her life long aspirations of running the trans continental railroad which has been in her family for several generations she deals with other characters such as hank rearden
a self made businessman of great integrity whose career is hindered by his false feelings of obligation towards his wife francisco d anconia dagny s childhood friend first love and king of the copper industry appears to have become a worthless playboy who is purposely destroying his business as the novel progresses the myths about the real john galt as well as francisco d anconia s actions become more and more a reflection of the state of the culture and seem to make
more and more sense and hank and dagny begin to experience the futility of their attempts to survive in a society that hates them and those like them for their greatness during their plight dagny and hank find the
remnants of a motor that turns atmospheric energy into kinetic energy an astounding feat they also find evidence that the minds the atlases of the world are disappearing because of one particular destroyer taking them away dagny and hank deal with the irrationalities and apparent contradictions of their atmosphere and search for the creator of the motor as well as
the destroyer who is draining the world of its prime movers in an effort to secure their ability to live rational lives all of this leads to an elaborate action based explanation and eventual climax presenting an understanding of all of the issues explored and breaking everything down into one basic conflict the final parts of the novel involve a speech by the story s true protagonist and a resolution concerning the fate of society the question who is john galt is also answered characters minor characters companies concepts places technology things topics of note film adaptation rights to the

senses it is concerned with all humans at all times and with all dimensions of humanity a primary trait that traditionally distinguished anthropology from other humanistic disciplines is an emphasis on cultural relativity indepth examination of context and cross cultural comparisons in
north america anthropology is traditionally divided into four sub disciplines physical anthropology or biological anthropology which studies primate behavior human evolution osteology forensics and population genetics cultural anthropology called social anthropology in the united kingdom and now often known as socio cultural anthropology areas studied by cultural anthropologists include
social networks diffusion social behavior kinship patterns law politics ideology religion beliefs patterns in production and consumption exchange socialization gender and other expressions of culture with strong emphasis on the importance of fieldwork or participant observation i e living among the social group being studied for an extended period of time linguistic anthropology which studies
variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture and archaeology that studies the material remains of human societies archaeology itself is normally treated as a separate but related field in the rest of the world although closely related to the anthropological field of material culture which deals with physical objects
created or used within a living or past group as mediums of understanding its cultural values more recently some anthropology programs began dividing the field into two one emphasizing the humanities and critical
theory the other emphasizing the natural sciences and empirical observation historical and institutional context main article history of anthropology the anthropologist t j brewer once characterized anthropology as the most scientific of the humanities and the most humanistic of the sciences understanding how anthropology developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines contemporary anthropologists claim a number of earlier thinkers as their forebearers and the discipline has several sources however anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the age of enlightenment it was during this period that europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior
traditions of jurisprudence history philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part at the same time the romantic reaction to the enlightenment produced thinkers such as herder and later wilhelm dilthey whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline institutionally anthropology
emerged from natural history expounded by authors such as buffon this was the study of human
beings typically people living in european colonies thus studying the language culture physiology and artifacts of european colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places it was for this reason for instance that lewis henry morgan could write monographs on both the league of the iroquois and the american beaver and his works this is also why the material culture of civilized nations such as china have historically been
displayed in fine arts museums alongside european art while artifacts from africa or native north american cultures were displayed in natural history museums with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas this being said curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an
extension of colonial rule and european chauvinism since its relationship to imperialism was and is complex anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form by one nine three five for example it was possible for t k penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled a hundred years of anthropology early anthropology was dominated by the comparative method it was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive
to most advanced non european societies were thus seen as evolutionary living fossils that could be
studied in order to understand the european past scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful it was during this time that europeans first accurately traced polynesian migrations across the pacific ocean for instance although some of them believed it originated in egypt finally the concept of race was actively discussed as a way to classify and rank
human beings based on inherent biological difference in the twentieth century academic disciplines began to organize around three main domains the sciences seeks to derive natural laws through reproducible and falsifiable
experiments the humanities reflected an attempt to study different national traditions in the form of history and the arts as an attempt to provide people in emerging nation states with a sense of coherence the social sciences emerged at this time as an attempt to develop scientific methods to address social phenomena in an attempt
to provide a universal basis for social knowledge anthropology does
not easily fit into one of these categories and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains drawing on the methods of the natural sciences as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured participant observation and drawing on the new theory of evolution through natural selection they proposed the scientific study of a new object humankind conceived of as a whole crucial to
this study is the concept culture which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning thinking and acting which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes homo sapiens and perhaps all species of genus homo from other species and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices thus culture not only transcends the opposition between nature
and nurture it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly european distinction between politics religion kinship and the economy as autonomous domains anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences social sciences and humanities to explore the biological linguistic material and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms anthropology in the u s anthropology in the united states was pioneered by staff of the bureau of indian affairs and the smithsonian institution s bureau of american ethnology such as john wesley powell and frank
hamilton cushing academic anthropology was established by franz boas who used his positions at columbia university and the american museum
of natural history to train and develop multiple generations of students boasian anthropology was politically active and suspicious of research dictated by the u s government or wealthy patrons it was also rigorously empirical and skeptical of over generalizations and attempts to establish universal laws boas studied immigrant children in order to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable and that human conduct and behavior was the result of nurture rather than nature drawing on his german roots he argued that the world was full of distinct cultures
rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little civilization they had boas felt that each culture has to be studied in its particularity and argued that cross cultural generalizations like those made in the natural sciences were not possible in doing so boas fought discrimination against immigrants african americans and native north americans many american anthropologists adopted boas agenda for social reform and theories
of race continue to be popular targets for anthropologists today boas s first generation of students included alfred kroeber robert lowie edward sapir and ruth benedict all of these scholars produced richly detailed studies which described native north america in doing so they provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process kroeber and sapir s focus on native american languages also helped establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on indo european languages the publication of alfred kroeber s
textbook anthropology marked a turning point in american anthropology after three decades of amassing material the urge to generalize grew this was most obvious in the culture and personality studies carried out by younger boasians such as margaret mead and ruth benedict influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists such as sigmund freud and carl jung these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up while such works as coming of age in samoa and the chrysanthemum and the sword remain popular with the american public
mead and benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that
some expected boas had planned for ruth benedict to succeed him as chair of
columbia s anthropology department but she was sidelined by ralph linton and mead was limited to her offices at the amnh anthropology in britain whereas boas picked his opponents to pieces through attention to detail in britain modern anthropology was formed by rejecting historical reconstruction in the name of a
science of society that focused on analyzing how societies held together in the present the two most important names in this tradition were alfred reginald radcliffe brown and bronislaw malinowski both of whom released seminal works in one nine two two radcliffe brown s initial fieldwork in the andaman islands was carried out in the old style but after reading mile durkheim he published an
account of his research entitled simply the andaman islanders which drew heavily on the french sociologist over time he developed an approach known as structural functionalism which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously malinowski on the other hand advocated an unhyphenated functionalism which examined how society functioned to meet individual needs malinowski is best known not for his theory however but for his detailed ethnography and advances in methodology his classic argonauts of the western pacific advocated getting
the native s point of view and an approach to field work
that became standard in the field malinowski and radcliffe brown s success stem from the fact that they like boas actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions which furthered their programmatic ambitions this was particularly the case with radcliffe brown who spread his agenda for social anthropology by teaching
at universities across the commonwealth from the late one nine three zero s until the post war period a string of monographs and edited volumes appeared which cemented the paradigm of british social anthropology famous ethnographies include the nuer by edward evan evans pritchard and the dynamics of clanship among the tallensi by meyer fortes while well known edited volumes include african systems of kinship and marriage and african political systems anthropology in france anthropology in france has a less clear genealogy than the british and american traditions most commentators consider marcel mauss to be the founder of the french
anthropological tradition mauss was a member of durkheim s annee sociologique group and while durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies mauss and his collaborators such as henri hubert and robert hertz drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as differentiated as european nation states in particular mauss s essay on the gift was to prove of enduring relevance in anthropological studies of exchange and reciprocity throughout the interwar years french interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider
cultural movements such as surrealism and primitivism which drew on ethnography for inspiration marcel griaule and michel leiris are examples
of people who combined anthropology with the french avant garde during this time most of what is known as ethnologie was restricted to museums and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of folklore above all however it was
claude l vi strauss who helped institutionalize anthropology in france in addition to the enormous influence his structuralism exerted across multiple disciplines l vi strauss established ties with american and british anthropologists at the same time he established centers and laboratories within france to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as maurice godelier and francoise heritier who would prove influential
in the world of french anthropology much of the distinct character of france s anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories rather than academic departments in universities anthropology
after world war two before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions it was after the war that the two would blend to create a sociocultural
anthropology in the one nine five zero s and mid one nine six zero s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the natural sciences some such as lloyd fallers and clifford geertz focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop others such as julian steward and leslie white focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche an approach popularized by marvin
harris economic anthropology as influenced by karl polanyi and practiced
by marshall sahlins and george dalton focused on how traditional economics ignored cultural and social factors in england british social anthropology s paradigm began to fragment as max gluckman and peter worsley experimented with marxism and authors such as rodney needham and edmund leach incorporated l vi strauss s structuralism into their work structuralism also influenced a number of development in one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis authors such as david schneider clifford geertz and marshall sahlins developed a more fleshed out concept of culture as
a web of meaning or signification which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline in keeping with the times much of anthropology became politicized through the algerian war of independence and opposition to the vietnam war marxism became a more and more popular
theoretical approach in the discipline by the one nine seven zero s the authors of volumes such as reinventing anthropology worried about anthropology
s relevance in the one nine eight zero s issues of power such as those examined in eric wolf s europe and the people without history were central to the discipline books like anthropology and the colonial encounter pondered anthropology s ties to colonial inequality while the immense
popularity of theorists such as antonio gramsci and michel foucault moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight gender and sexuality became a popular topic as did the relationship between history and anthropology influenced by marshall sahlins again who drew on l vi strauss and fernand braudel to examine the relationship between social structure and
individual agency in the late one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s authors such as george marcus and james clifford pondered ethnographic authority particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative ethnographies became more reflexive explicitly addressing the author s methodology and cultural positioning and its influence on their ethnographic analysis this was part of a more
general trend of postmodernism that was popular contemporaneously currently anthropologists have begun to pay attention to globalization medicine and biotechnology indigenous rights and the anthropology of europe politics of anthropology anthropology s traditional involvement with nonwestern cultures has involved it in politics in many different ways some political
problems arise simply because anthropologists usually have more power than the people they study some have argued that the discipline is a form of colonialist theft in which the anthropologist gains power at the expense of subjects the anthropologist they argue can gain yet more power by exploiting knowledge and artifacts of the people he studies while the people he studies gain nothing or even lose in the exchange an example of this exploitative relationship can been
seen in the collaboration in africa prior to world war ii of british anthropologists such as fortes and colonial forces more recently there have been newfound concerns about bioprospecting along with struggles for self representation for native peoples and the repatriation of indigenous remains and material culture other political controversies come from american anthropology s emphasis on cultural relativism and its long standing antipathy to the concept of race the development of sociobiology in the
late one nine six zero s was opposed by cultural anthropologists such as marshall sahlins who argued that these positions were reductive while authors such john randal baker continued to develop the biological concept of race into the one nine seven zero s the rise of genetics has proven to be central to developments on this front recently kevin b macdonald criticized boasian anthropology as part of a jewish strategy to facilitate mass immigration and
to weaken the west the culture of critique two zero zero two as genetics continues to advance as a science some anthropologists such as luca cavalli sforza have continued to transform and advance notions of race through the use of recent developments in genetics such as tracing past migrations of peoples through their mitcochondial and y chromosomal dna and ancestry informative markers finally anthropology has a
history of entanglement with government intelligence agencies and anti war politics boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and the collaboration of some anthropologists with us intelligence in contrast many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the war effort in some form including dozens who served in the office of strategic services and the office of war information in the one nine
five zero s the american anthropological association provided the cia information on the area specialities of its members and a number of anthropologists participated in the u
s government s operation camelot during the war in vietnam at the same time many other anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement and passed resolutions in the american anthropological association aaa condemning anthropological involvement in covert operations anthropologists were also vocal in their opposition to the war in iraq although there was no consensus amongst practitioners of the discipline professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements
may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the british association for social anthropology has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous for example the british association for social anthropology has condemned the cia s pat roberts intelligence scholars program which funds anthropology students at us universities in preparation for them to spy for the united states government the aaa s current statement of professional responsibility clearly states that in relation with their own government
and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given anthropology is the study of
human diversity diversity of body and behavior in the past and present anthropology consists of four subfields or subdisciplines physical anthropology studies the diversity
of the human body in the past and present it includes how we acquired the structure of our body over time that is human evolution as well as differences and relationships between human populations today and their adaptations to their local environments it also sometimes includes the evolution and diversity of our nearest relatives the primates apes and monkeys cultural anthropology studies the diversity of human behavior in the present this is what most anthropologists do and what most
of the public sees when they look at national geographic magazine or the discovery channel on tv cultural anthropologists travel to foreign societies although it is possible to do anthropology on your own society live among the people there and try as much as they can to understand how those people live archaeology studies the diversity of human behavior in the past since
it studies how people lived in the past these people are not available for us to visit and talk to or at least not people who are currently living in the same way that their ancestors did in the past therefore archaeologists must depend on the artifacts and features that the people produced in the past and attempt to reconstruct their vanished way of life from the remnants of their culture linguistic anthropology studies the diversity of human language in the past and present while
language is naturally a part of culture it is such a huge topic that anthropologists have separated it into its own area of study linguistic anthropologists are concerned about
the development of languages perhaps even back to the first forms of language and
how language changes over time they are also interested in how different contemporary languages differ today how they are related and how we can learn about things like migration and diffusion from that data they also ask how language is related to and reflects on other aspects of culture other sciences study humans too of course history economics psychology sociology even biology and chemistry can study humans how is anthropology different the answer is the anthropological perspective that is the way that anthropology approaches the subject and thinks about or studies humans and their behavior the anthropological perspective has three
components one cross cultural or comparative anthropology investigates humans in every form that they take we are interested to see the entire spectrum of human bodies and behaviors trying to learn the range of humanity all the ways that we can be human by seeing humans in their every manifestation and comparing those manifestations to each other we can ask what is possible for humans and what is necessary for humans two holistic anthropology tries to relate every part of culture to every other part it understands that the various parts of culture are connected to
each other and that certain combinations tend to occur or not to occur for example there are no hunting and gathering cultures that traditionally lived in cities that s just impossible we are also interested in how a people s cultures
is connected to their environment again without high technology you are not going to see farming or cities in the middle of the desert or the arctic three relativistic this is the most profound yet controversial part of the anthropological perspective relativism means that the rules or norms or values of a culture are relative to that specific
culture in other words say monogamy may be normal or preferred in one culture but polygamy may be normal or preferred in another the point is that different cultures believe different things or value different things or even mean different things with perhaps identical looking behaviors or objects when you go to another culture or even just interact with another culture for
example when you are doing international business you cannot assume that other people understand things the same way you do in fact you should assume that they don t anthropology counsels against hasty judgement of a new culture aspects that a western visitor may find strange or distasteful can be understood when
situated within that culture s history and cosmology understanding of the world there will be a rationality for the phenomenon it may be rational however
according to a cultural logic that conflicts with western understandings malinowski s primacy of seeking to understand the native point of view remains fundamental to socio cultural anthropology today the point is that if we want to understand other people properly we must see what their behaviors or words or concepts mean to them not what they would mean to us meaning is relative to the culture that creates that meaning this is not to say that all things are true or even that all things are good cultural relativism does not necessarily
entail moral relativism indeed the american anthropological association s qualified support one nine four eight one nine nine seven for the universal declaration of human rights as
well as work by sally engle merry shows the latter is not a common anthropological point of view how does anthropology study culture one other way that anthropology is unique among the sciences that study humans is by its emphasis on fieldwork you cannot get to know another
culture just by reading about it or watching movies about it at best you could learn what other people have already discovered but you could not learn anything new so
anthropology requires actually going to that society and living within their culture as much as possible this is called participant observation this depends crucially on finding preferrably friendly informants within the society who will teach you their culture s rules of social behaviour and include you in their activities then as much as possible you
will try to eat their food speak their language and live their lives often actually residing with a family in that society it is not easy work and it is not always fun but there is no better way to learn anthropological fields and subfields biological anthropology also physical anthropology forensic

and word speech discourse is the study of human cultures
through the recovery documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data including architecture artifacts biofacts human remains and landscapes the goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human culture understand culture history chronicle cultural evolution and study human behavior and ecology for both prehistoric and historic societies it is considered to be one of the four sub fields of anthropology usage as with words
such as encyclopedia and gynaecology archaeology traditionally has an ae combination however unlike other words the ae is all but universally retained contrary to popular belief in other parts of
the world the spelling archeology is not predominant in united states dictionaries and would look quite odd to most americans like the claim that theater refers to a building and theatre refers to the performing arts the belief that archeology is an americanism is little more than an urban myth the traditional spelling archaeology continues to be
used in everyday writing throughout the world including the u s even more so than theatre the alternate spelling of which while considered acceptable is preferred less often than not ontology and definition in the old world archaeology has tended to focus on the study of physical remains the methods used in recovering them and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings in achieving the subject s goals the discipline s roots in antiquarianism and the study of latin and ancient greek provided it with a natural affinity with
the field of history in the new world archaeology is more commonly devoted to the study of human societies and is treated as one of
the four subfields of anthropology the other subfields of anthropology supplement the findings of archaeology in a
holistic manner these subfields are cultural anthropology which studies behavioural symbolic and material dimensions of culture linguistics which studies language including the origins of language and language groups and
physical anthropology which includes the study of human evolution and physical and genetic characteristics other disciplines also supplement archaeology such as paleontology paleozoology paleoethnobotany paleobotany geography geology art history and classics archaeology has been described as a craft that enlists the
sciences to illuminate the humanities writing in one nine four eight the american archaeologist walter taylor asserted that archaeology is neither
history nor anthropology as an autonomous discipline it consists of a method and a set of specialised techniques for the gathering or production of cultural information archaeology is an approach
to understanding human culture through its material remains regardless of chronology in england archaeologists have uncovered the long lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned
after the crises of the one four th century and the equally lost layouts of one seven th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion in downtown new york city archaeologists have exhumed the one eight th century remains of the black burial ground traditional archaeology is viewed
as the study of pre historical human cultures that is cultures that existed before the development of writing for that culture historical archaeology is the study of post writing cultures
in the study of relatively recent cultures which have been observed and studied by western scholars archaeology is closely allied with ethnography this is the case in large parts of north america oceania siberia and other places where the study of archaeology mingles with the living traditions of the cultures being studied kennewick man is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture in
the study of cultures that were literate or had literate neighbours history and archaeology
supplement one another for broader understanding of the complete cultural context as at hadrian s wall importance and applicability most of human history is not described by any written records writing did not exist anywhere in the world until about five zero zero zero years ago and only spread among
a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilisations in contrast homo sapiens have existed for at least two zero zero zero zero zero years and other species of homo for millions of years see human evolution these civilisations are not coincidentally the best known they have been open to the inquiry of historians for centuries while the
study of pre historic cultures has arisen only recently even within a civilisation that is literate at some levels many important human practices are not officially recorded any knowledge of the formative early years of human civilisation the development of agriculture cult practices of folk religion the rise of the first cities must come from archaeology even where written records do exist they are invariably incomplete or biased to some extent in many societies literacy was restricted to the elite classes such as
the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple the literacy even of an aristocracy has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts the interests and world view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the rest of the populace writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity thus written records
tend to reflect the biases of the literate classes and cannot be trusted as a sole source the material record is nearer to a fair
representation of society though it is subject to its own inaccuracies such as sampling bias and differential preservation in addition to their scientific importance archaeological remains sometimes have political significance to descendants of the people who produced them monetary value to collectors or simply strong aesthetic appeal many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic religious political or
economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies this view is often espoused in works of popular fiction such as raiders of the lost ark the mummy and king solomon s mines when such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents see pseudoarchaeology below however these endeavours real and fictional are not representative of the modern state of archaeology goals there is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies these include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites digging
sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains every phase of this process can be a source of information the goals of archaeology are not always the same there are at least three broad distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do these are beyond the scope of the present discussion and are discussed at length below nevertheless there is much
common ground academic sub disciplines main article archaeological sub disciplines as with most academic disciplines there are a very large number of archaeological sub disciplines characterised by a specific method or type of material e g lithic analysis music archaeobotany geographical or chronological focus e g near eastern archaeology medieval archaeology other thematic concern e g landscape archaeology or a specific archaeological culture or civilisation e g egyptology cultural resources management cultural resources management crm also called
heritage management in britain is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the united states and much of that in western europe as well in the united states crm archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the national historic preservation act of one nine six six and most of the archaeology done
in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure in the united states the vast majority of taxpayers scholars and politicians believe that crm has helped to preserve much of that nation s history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities dams and highways along with other statutes this mandates that no construction project on public land or involving public funds may damage an unstudied archaeological site the
application of crm in the united kingdom is not limited to government funded projects since one nine nine zero ppg one six has required planners to consider archaeology as a material consideration in determining applications for new development as a result numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of or during construction work in
archaeologically sensitive areas at the developer s expense among the goals of crm are the identification preservation and maintenance of cultural sites on public and private lands and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity such as proposed construction this study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction if these do exist time and money must be allotted for their excavation if initial survey
and or test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site the construction
may be prohibited entirely crm is a thriving entity especially in the united states and europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government
engage in the practice of their discipline cultural resources management has however been criticized crm is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget it is not unheard of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for
the least funding crm archaeologists face considerable time pressure often being forced to complete their work in a
fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour field methods survey a modern archaeological project often begins with
a survey regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest such as houses and middens within a site each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods survey was not widely
practiced in the early days of archaeology cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace and excavating only the plainly visible features there gordon willey pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in one nine four nine in the viru valley of coastal peru and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise
to or even in place of excavation it requires relatively little time and expense because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts nevertheless surveying a large region or site can be expensive so archaeologists often employ sampling methods it avoids ethical issues of particular concern to descendant peoples associated with destroying a site through excavation it is the only way to gather some forms of information such as settlement patterns and settlement structure survey data
are commonly assembled into maps which may show surface features and or artefact distribution
the simplest survey technique is surface survey it involves combing an area usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface surface survey cannot
detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth or overgrown with vegetation surface survey may also include mini excavation techniques such as augers corers and shovel test pits aerial survey is conducted using cameras attached to aircraft balloons or even kites a bird s eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites aerial imaging can also detect
many things not visible from the surface plants growing above a stone structure such as a wall will develop more slowly while those above other types of features such as middens may develop more rapidly photographs of ripening grain which changes colour rapidly at maturation have revealed buried structures with great
precision aerial survey also employs infrared ground penetrating radar wavelengths and thermography geophysical survey is the most effective way to see beneath the ground magnetometers detect minute deviations in the earth s magnetic field caused by iron artefacts
kilns some types of stone structures and even ditches and middens devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used most soils are moist below the surface which gives them a relatively low resistivity features such as hard packed floors or
concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity although some archaeologists consider the use of metal detectors to be
tantamount to treasure hunting others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on english civil war battlefields metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck and service cable location during evaluation metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising
artifacts from their archaeological context in the uk metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the portable antiquities scheme regional survey in maritime archaeology uses side scan sonar excavation archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs and it remains the source
of the majority of data recovered in most field projects it can reveal several
types of information usually not accessible to survey such as stratigraphy three dimensional structure and verifiably primary context modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features known as their provenance or provenience be recorded this always involves determining their horizontal locations
and sometimes vertical position as well also see primary laws of archaeology similarly their association or relationship with nearby objects and features needs to be recorded for later analysis this allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity for example excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research also as a
destructive process it carries ethical concerns as a result very few sites are excavated in their entirety sampling is even more important in excavation than in survey it is common for large mechanical equipment such as backhoes jcbs to be used in excavation especially to remove the topsoil overburden though this method is increasingly used with great caution following this rather dramatic step the exposed area is usually hand cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are
apparent the next task is to form a site plan and then use it to help decide the method of excavation features dug into the natural subsoil are normally excavated in portions in order
to produce a visible archaeological section for recording scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site black and white and colour photographs of them are taken and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each all this information serves as a permanent record of the now destroyed archaeology and
is used in describing and interpreting the site post excavation analysis once artefacts and structures have been excavated or collected from surface surveys it is necessary to properly study them to gain as much data as possible this process is known as post excavation analysis and is normally the most time consuming part of the archaeological investigation it is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be
published at its most basic the artefacts found are cleaned catalogued and compared to published collections in order to classify them typologically and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages however a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological
science meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined the bones plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed using the techniques of zooarchaeology paleoethnobotany and palynology while any texts can usually be deciphered these techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site history of archaeology main article history of archaeology the history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation and the
use of an increasing range of techniques to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible excavations of ancient monuments
and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts it was only in the one nine th century that the systematic
study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals including augustus pitt rivers and william flinders petrie this process was continued in the two zero th century by such people as mortimer wheeler whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained during the two zero th century the development of urban archaeology and then rescue archaeology have been important factors as has the development of archaeological science which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is
possible to obtain archaeological theory main article archaeological theory there is no single theory of archaeology and even definitions are disputed until the mid two zero th century and the introduction of technology there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology the first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as cultural or culture history which was developed during the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries in the one nine six zero s a number of young primarily american archaeologists such as lewis binford
rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history they proposed a new archaeology which would be more scientific and anthropological with hypothesis testing and the scientific method very important parts of what became known as processual archaeology in the one nine eight zero s a new movement arose led by the british archaeologists michael shanks
christopher tilley daniel miller and ian hodder it questioned processualism s appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism becoming known as post processual archaeology however this approach has been criticised by processualists
as lacking scientific rigour the validity of both processualism and post procuessualism is still under debate archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences including neo darwinian evolutionary thought phenomenology postmodernism agency theory cognitive science functionalism gender based and feminist archaeology and systems theory public archaeology early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities such pursuits continue to fascinate the public portrayed in books such as king solomon s mines and films
such as the mummy and raiders of the lost ark much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as cop n and the valley of the kings but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational in addition archaeological adventure stories tend to
ignore the painstaking work involved in modern survey excavation and data processing techniques some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as pseudoarchaeology nevertheless archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of indiana jones films and tomb raider games as the inspiration for them to
enter the field archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed
without a strong public interest in the subject often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require in the uk popular archaeology programmes such as time team and meet the ancestors have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest where possible archaeologists now make more provision
for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did however the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour and even this is less freely available than before developer funded excavation necessitates a well trained staff that can work quickly and accurately observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in
working on a modern building site with tight deadlines certain charities and local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project there is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial training excavations and archaeological holiday tours archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group pseudoarchaeology main
article pseudoarchaeology pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices it includes much fictional archaeological work discussed above as well as some actual activity many non fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology or the specific critiques of it contained in post processualism an example of this type is the writing of erich von d niken his chariots of the gods
one nine six eight together with many subsequent lesser known works expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations this theory known as palaeocontact theory is not exclusively d niken s nor did the
idea originate with him works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well established theories on the basis of limited evidence and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind looting looting of archaeological sites by people in search of hoards of buried treasure is an ancient problem for instance many of the tombs of the egyptian pharaohs were looted in antiquity the advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest but it has also attracted unwelcome
attention to the works of past peoples a brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the illicit antiquities trade which smuggles items abroad to private collectors looters damage the integrity of a historic site deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation and are often deemed to be robbing local people of their heritage the popular consciousness often associates looting with poor third world countries many are former homes to many well known
ancient civilizations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites certainly the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmer s income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people however looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the united states and western europe as well abandoned towns of the ancient sinagua people of arizona clearly visible in the desert landscape have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted
where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night with the metal detector a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig public outreach motivated by a desire to halt looting curb pseudoarchaeology and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work archaeologists are mounting public outreach campaigns they seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to
science and their own heritage common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation the final audience for archaeologists work is the public and it is increasingly realised that
their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them the putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects
and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites descendant peoples in the united states examples such as the case of kennewick man have illustrated the tensions between native americans and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them for years american archaeologists dug on indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for
further study in some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied furthermore western archaeologists views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples the west views time as linear for many natives it is cyclic from a western perspective the past is long gone from a native perspective disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present
to an archaeologist the past is long gone and must be reconstructed through its material remains to indigenous peoples it is often still alive as a consequence of this american indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors while american archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue
their studies this contradictory situation was addressed by the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra one nine nine zero which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right
of research institutions to possess human remains due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of indigenous peoples likely to be descended from those under study archaeologists have also been obliged to re examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space to many native peoples natural features such as
lakes mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study while this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork it has benefits for all parties involved tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists
can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred while the archaeologists gain the elders aid in interpreting their finds there have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession repatriation a new trend in the heated controversy between first nations groups and scientists is the repatriation of native artifacts
to the original descendants an example of this occurred june two one two zero zero five when a community members and elders from a number of the one zero algonquian nations in the ottawa area convened on the kitigan zibi reservation in
kanawagi quebec to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods some dating back six zero zero zero years the ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles the remains and artifacts including beads tools and weapons were originally excavated from various sites in the ottawa valley including morrison and the allumette islands they had been part of the canadian museum of civilization
s research collection for decades some since the late one eight zero zero s elders from various algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial eventually deciding on traditional redcedar and birchbark boxes lined with redcedar chips muskrat and beaver pelts now an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to nine zero boxes of various sizes are buried although negotiations
were at times tense between the kitigan zibi community and museum they were able to reach agreement source canadian geographic online see also list of significant archaeological discoveries list of archaeological sites sorted by country list of archaeologists biblical archaeology list of archaeological periods prehistory external links archeologia

areas it can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interation with nature history of agricultural science main article history of agricultural science agricultural science is seen by some to have began
with mendel s insightful genetc work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in eighteenth century germany today it is very different from what it was even in one nine five zero intensification of agriculture since the one nine six zero s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to
progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new
fields these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological
problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non essential eeconomic goods in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science new technologies
such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the

islamic empire and then in europe up to the one nine th century in a complex network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least two five zero zero years western alchemy has always been closely connected with hermeticism a philosophical and spiritual system that traces its roots to hermes trismegistus a syncretic egyptian greek deity and legendary alchemist these two
disciplines influenced the birth of rosicrucianism an important esoteric movement of the one seven th century in the
one nine th century as mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry its mystic and hermetic aspects became the focus of a modern spiritual alchemy where material manipulations are viewed as mere symbols of spiritual transformations the alchemists did not follow what is now known as the scientific method and much of the knowledge they produced was later found to be banal limited
wrong or meaningless today the discipline is of interest mainly to historians of science and philosophy and for its mystic esoteric and artistic aspects nevertheless alchemy was one of the main precursors of modern sciences and we owe to the ancient alchemists the discovery of many substances and processes that are the mainstay of modern chemical and metallurgical industries overview the alchemist by sir william fettes douglas alchemy as a proto science the common perception of alchemists is that they were pseudo scientists crackpots and charlatans who
attempted to turn lead into gold believed that the universe was composed of the four elements of
earth air fire and water and spent most of their time concocting miraculous remedies poisons and magic potions this picture is rather unfair although many alchemists were indeed crackpots and charlatans many were well meaning and intelligent scholars who were simply struggling to make sense of a subject which as we now
know was far beyond the reach of their tools these people were basically proto scientists who attempted to explore and investigate the nature of chemical substances and processes they had to rely on unsystematic experimentation traditional know how rules of thumb and plenty of speculative thought to fill in the wide gaps in existing knowledge given these conditions the mystic character of alchemy is quite understandable to the early alchemist chemical transformations could only seem like magical phenomena
governed by incomprehensible laws whose potential and limitations he had no way of knowing having discovered that a specific procedure could turn an earth like ore into glistening metal it was only natural to speculate that some different procedure could turn a metal into another at the same time it was clear to the alchemists that something was generally being conserved in chemical processes
even in the most dramatic changes of physical state and appearance i e that substances contained some principles that
could be hidden under many outer forms and revealed by proper manipulation throughout the history of the discipline alchemists struggled very hard to understand the nature
of these principles and find some order and sense in the results of their chemical experiments which were often undermined by impure or poorly characterized reagents the lack of quantitative measurements
and confusing and inconsistent nomenclature in spite of those difficulties and of many false turns and loops the alchemists managed to make steady
progress in the understanding of the natural world to them we owe the discovery of many important substances and chemical processes which paved the way for the modern science of chemistry and are still the mainstay of today s chemical and metallurgical industries alchemy as a philosophical and
spiritual discipline the best known goals of the alchemists were the transmutation of common metals into gold or silver and the creation of a panacea a
remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely starting with the middle ages european alchemists invested much effort
on the search for the philosopher s stone a mythical substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals alchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries though not for their pursuit of those unattainable goals nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature rather it was for their mundane contributions to the chemical industries of the day ore testing and refining metalworking production of ink dyes paints and cosmetics leather tanning ceramics and glass
manufacture preparation of extracts and liquors and so on it seems that the preparation of aqua vitae the water of life was a fairly popular experiment among european alchemists on the other hand alchemists never had the intellectual tools nor the motivation to separate the physical chemical aspects of their craft from the metaphysical interpretations indeed
from antiquity until well into the modern age a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation for one thing the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes as well as the need for secrecy led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of biblical and pagan mythology astrology kabbalah and other mystic and esoteric fields so that even the plainest chemical recipe ended up reading like
an abstruse magic incantation moreover alchemists sought in those fields the theoretical frameworks into which they could fit their growing collection of disjointed experimental facts starting with the middle
ages some alchemists increasingly came to view these metaphysical aspects as the true foundation of alchemy and chemical substances physical states and material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities states and transformations thus both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral
state towards a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state and the philosopher s stone then represented some mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented some hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic
works and must be laborously decoded in order to discover their true meaning some humanistic scholars now see these spiritual and metaphysical allegories as the truest and most valuable aspect of alchemy and even claim that the development of chemistry out of alchemy was a corruption of the original hermetic tradition this is the view espoused by contemporary practitioners of spiritual alchemy most scientists on the other hand tend to take quite the
opposite view to them the path from the material side of alchemy to modern chemistry was the straight road in the evolution of the discipline while the metaphysically oriented brand of alchemy was a wrong turn that led to nowhere in either view however the na ve interpretations of some practitoners or the fraudulent hopes fostered by others should not diminish the contribution of the more sincere alchemists alchemy and astrology since its earliest times alchemy has been closely connected to astrology which in islam and europe
generally meant the traditional babylonian greek school of astrology alchemical
systems often postulated that each of the seven planets known to the ancients ruled or was associated with a certain metal see the separate article on astrology and alchemy for further details alchemy in the age of science up to the one eight th century alchemy was actually considered serious science in europe for instance isaac newton devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics for
which he is famous see isaac newton s occult studies other eminent alchemists of the western world are roger bacon saint thomas aquinas tycho
brahe thomas browne and parmigianino the decline of alchemy began in the one eight th century with the birth of modern chemistry which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine within a new grand design of the universe
based on rational materialism in the first half of the nineteenth century one established chemist baron carl reichenbach researched on concepts similar to the old alchemy such as the odic force but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion matter transmutation the old goal of alchemy enjoyed a moment in the sun in the two zero th century when physicists were able to convert lead atoms into gold atoms via a nuclear reaction however
the new gold atoms being unstable isotopes lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart more recently reports of table top element transmutation by means of electrolysis or sonic cavitation were the pivot of the cold
fusion controversy of one nine eight nine none of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated alchemical symbolism has been
occasionally used in the two zero th century by psychologists and
philosophers carl jung reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a spiritual path alchemical philosophy symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in post modern contexts such as the new age movement even some physicists have played with alchemical ideas in books such as the tao of physics and the dancing wu li masters alchemy as a subject of historical research the history of
alchemy has become a vigorous academic field as the obscure hermetic of course language of the alchemists is gradually being deciphered historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other
facets of western cultural history such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements cryptography witchcraft and of course the evolution of science and philosophy etymology the word alchemy comes from the arabic al k miya or al kh miya or which might be formed from the article al and the greek word chumeia meaning cast together pour together weld alloy etc from khumatos that which is poured out an ingot or from
persian kimia meaning gold a decree of diocletian written about three zero zero ce in greek speaks against the ancient writings of the egyptians which treat of the kh
mia transmutation of gold and silver it has been suggested that the arabic word al k miya actually means the egyptian science borrowing from
the coptic word for egypt k me or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic kh me the coptic word derives from demotic km itself from ancient egyptian kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding desert so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts however this theory may be just an example of folk
etymology history extract and symbol key from a one seven th century book on alchemy the symbols used have a one to one correspondence with symbols used in astrology at the time alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least two major strands which appear to be largely independent at
least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and its zone of cultural influence and western alchemy whose center has shifted over the millennia between egypt greece and rome the islamic world and finally back to europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system with only superficial connections to the major western religions it is still an open question whether these two strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other alchemy in ancient egypt the origin of western alchemy
may generally be traced to ancient pharaonic egypt metallurgy and mysticism were inexorably tied together in the ancient world as the transformation of drab ore into shining metal must have seemed to be
an act of magic governed by mysterious rules it is claimed therefore that alchemy in ancient egypt was the domain of
the priestly class egyptian alchemy is known mostly through the writings of ancient hellenic greek philosophers which in turn have often survived only in islamic translations practically no original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived those writings if they existed were likely lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical
books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria two nine two which had been a center of egyptian alchemy nevertheless archaeological expeditions
in recent times have unearthed evidence of chemical analysis during the naqada periods for example a copper tool dating to the naqada era bears evidence of having been used in such a way reference artifact five four three seven on display at also the process
of tanning animal skins was already known in predynastic egypt as early as the six th millennium bc although it possibly was discovered haphazardly other evidence indicates early alchemists in ancient egypt had invented mortar by four zero zero zero bc and glass by one five zero zero bc the chemical
reaction involved in the production of calcium oxide is one of the oldest known references calcium oxide limekiln caco three heat cao co two ancient egypt additionally produced cosmetics cement faience and also pitch for shipbuilding papyrus had also been invented by three zero zero zero bc legend has it that the
founder of egyptian alchemy was the god thoth called hermes thoth or thrice great hermes hermes trismegistus by the greek according to legend he wrote what were called the forty two books of knowledge covering all fields of knowledge including alchemy hermes
s symbol was the caduceus or serpent staff which became one
of many of alchemy s principal symbols the emerald tablet or hermetica of thrice great hermes which is known only through greek and arabic translations is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners the first point of the emerald tablet tells the purpose of hermetical science in truth certainly and without doubt whatever is below is like that which is above and whatever is above is
like that which is below to accomplish the miracles of one thing this is the macrocosm microcosm belief central to the hermetic philosophy in other words the human body the microcosm is affected by the exterior world the macrocosm which includes the heavens through astrology and the earth through the elements it has been speculated that a riddle from the emerald tablet it was carried in the womb by the wind refers to the distillation of oxygen from saltpeter a process that was unknown in europe
until its re discovery by sendivogius in the one seven th century in the four th century bc the greek speaking macedonians conquered egypt and founded the city of alexandria in three three two this brought them into contact with egyptian ideas see alchemy in the greek world below chinese alchemy whereas western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine the philosopher s stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by
chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher s stone was often
equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than it initially appears black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists described in nine th century texts and used in fireworks by the one zero th century it was used in cannons by one two nine zero from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the arab world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against
the hungarians in one two four one and in europe starting with the one four th century black powder was most likely invented in the middle east before it found its way to china saltpeter the critical oxidising component was found naturally in india and along the salt trade routes in the middle east chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu although some tai
chi schools believe that their art derives from the hygienic
or philosophical branches of taoism not the alchemical indian alchemy little is known in the west about the character and history of indian alchemy an one one th century persian alchemist named al biruni reported
that they have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them which is called rasav tam it means the art which is restricted to certain operations drugs compounds and medicines most of which are taken from plants its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age the best example of a text based on this science is the vaishashik darshana of kanada fl six zero zero bc who described an atomic
theory over a century before democritus the texts of ayurvedic medicine and science have aspects related to alchemy such having cures for all known diseases the similarities in ayurveda and alchemy are that both had methods used to treat people by putting oils over
them some people have also noted certain similarities between the metaphysics of the samkhya philosophical tradition of hinduism and the metaphysics of alchemy whether there is any direct
connection between the two systems is an open question the rasavadam was understood by very few people at the time two famous examples were nagarjunacharya and nityanadhiya nagarjunacharya was a buddhist monk who in ancient times ran the great university of nagarjuna sagar his famous book rasaratanakaram is a famous example of early indian medicine in traditional indian medicinal terminology rasa translates as mercury and nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert
the mercury into gold much of his original writings are lost to us but his teachings still have strong influence on traditional indian medicine ayureveda to this day alchemy in the greek world the greek city of alexandria in egypt was a center of greek alchemical knowledge and retained its preeminence through most of the greek and roman periods the greeks appropriated the hermetical beliefs of the egyptians and melded with them the philosophies of pythagoreanism ionianism and gnosticism pythagorean philosophy is essentially the belief that numbers rule the universe originating from the observations of sound stars and
geometric shapes like triangles or anything from which a ratio could be derived ionian thought was based on the belief that the universe could be explained through concentration on natural phenomena this philosophy is believed to have originated with thales and his pupil anaximander and later developed by plato and aristotle whose works came to be an integral part of alchemy according to this belief the universe can be described by a few unified natural laws that can be determined only through careful thorough and exacting philosophical explorations the
third component introduced to hermetical philosophy by the greeks was gnosticism a belief prevalent in the christian and early post christian roman empire that the world is imperfect because it was created in a flawed manner
and that learning about the nature of spiritual matter would lead to salvation they further believed that god did not create the universe in the classic sense but that the universe was created from him but was corrupted in the process rather than becoming corrupted by the transgressions of adam and eve i e original sin according to gnostic belief by worshipping the cosmos nature or the creatures of the world one worships the true god gnostics do not seek salvation from sin but instead
seek to escape ignorance believing that sin is merely a consequence of ignorance platonic and neo platonic theories about universals and the omnipotence of god were also absorbed one very
important concept introduced at this time originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air
water and fire according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word the four elements are
simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists if plato and aristotle can be called alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy in the roman empire the romans adopted greek alchemy and metaphysics just as they adopted much of greek knowledge and philosophy by the end of the roman empire the greek alchemical philosophy had been joined to the philosophies of the egyptians to create the cult of
hermeticism however the development of christianity in the empire brought a contrary line of thinking stemming from augustine three five four four three zero ad an early christian philosopher who wrote of his beliefs shortly before the fall of the roman empire in essence he felt that reason and faith could be used to understand god but experimental philosophy was evil there is also present in the soul by means of these same bodily sense a kind of empty longing and curiosity which aims not at taking pleasure in the
flesh but at acquiring experience through the flesh and this empty curiosity he is dignified by the names of learning and science augustinian ideas were decidedly anti experimental yet when aristotelian experimental techniques were made available to the west they were not shunned still augustinian thought was well ingrained in medieval society and was used to show alchemy as being un godly much of the roman knowledge of alchemy like that of the greeks and egyptians is now lost in alexandria the centre of alchemical
studies in the roman empire the art was mainly oral and in the interests of secrecy little was committed to paper whence the use of hermetic to mean secretive it is possible that some writing was done in alexandria and that it was subsequently lost or destroyed in fires and the turbulent periods that followed alchemy in the islamic world after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the middle east much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of
the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as islamic translations the islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy platonic
and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated
islamic alchemists such as al razi latin rasis or rhazes contributed key chemical discoveries of their own such as the technique of distillation the words alembic and alcohol are of arabic origin the muriatic sulfuric and nitric acids soda potash and more from the arabic names of the last two substances al natrun and al qal y latinized into natrium and kalium come the modern
symbols for sodium and potassium the discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir ibn hayyan arabic latin geberus usually rendered in english
as geber jabir s ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to geber in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold
and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosopher s stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance s name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element s physical properties it is now commonly
accepted that chinese alchemy influenced arabic alchemists although the extent of that influence is still a matter of debate likewise hindu learning was assimilated into islamic alchemy but again the extent and effects of this are not well known alchemy in medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosophers stone by joseph wright of derby one seven seven one because
of its strong connections to the greek and roman cultures alchemy was rather easily accepted into christian philosophy and medieval european alchemists extensively absorbed islamic alchemical knowledge gerbert of aurillac who was later to become pope silvester ii d one zero zero three was among the first to bring islamic science to europe from spain later men such as adelard of bath who lived in the one two th century brought additional learning but until the one three th century the moves were mainly assimilative in this period there appeared some deviations from the augustinian principles of earlier
christian thinkers saint anselm one zero three three one one zero nine was a benedictine who believed faith must precede rationalism as augustine and most theologians prior to anselm had believed but anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a
christian context his views set the stage for the philosophical explosion to occur peter abelard followed anselm s work laying the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle reached the west his major influence on alchemy was his belief that platonic universals did not have
a separate existence outside of man s consciousness abelard also systematized the analysis of philosophical contradictions robert grosseteste one one seven zero one two five three was a pioneer of the scientific theory that would later be used and refined by the alchemists he took abelard s
methods of analysis and added the use of observations experimentation and conclusions in making scientific evaluations grosseteste also did much work to bridge platonic and aristotelian thinking albertus magnus one one nine three one two eight zero and thomas aquinas one two two five one two seven four were both dominicans who studied aristotle and worked at reconciling the differences between philosophy and christianity aquinas also did a
great deal of work in developing the scientific method he even went as far as claiming that universals could be discovered only through logical reasoning and since reason could not run in opposition to god reason must be compatible with theology this ran contrary to the commonly held platonic belief that universals were found through divine illumination alone magnus and aquinas were among the first to take up the examination of alchemical theory and
could be considered to be alchemists themselves except that these two did little in the way of experimentation the first true alchemist in medieval europe
was roger bacon his work did as much for alchemy as robert boyle s was to do for chemistry and galileo s for astronomy and
physics bacon one two one four one two nine four was an oxford franciscan who explored optics and languages in addition to alchemy the franciscan ideals of taking on the world rather than rejecting the world led to his conviction that experimentation was more important than reasoning of the three ways in which men think that they acquire knowledge of things authority reasoning and experience only the last is effective and able to
bring peace to the intellect bacon p three six seven experimental science controls the conclusions of all other sciences it reveals truths which reasoning from general principles would
never have discovered roger bacon has also been attributed with originating the search for the philosopher s stone and the elixir of life that medicine which will remove all impurities and corruptibilities from the lesser metals will also in the opinion
of the wise take off so much of the corruptibility of the body that human life may be prolonged for many centuries the idea of immortality was replaced with the notion of long life after all man s time on earth was simply to wait and prepare for immortality in the world of god immortality on earth did not mesh with christian theology bacon was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages but he was the most significant his works were used by countless alchemists of the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries other alchemists of bacon
s time shared several traits first and most obviously nearly all were members of the clergy this was simply because few people outside the parochial schools had the education to examine the arabic derived works also alchemy at this time was sanctioned by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology alchemy was interesting to the wide variety of
churchmen because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe when men were just beginning to learn about rationalism so by the end of the thirteenth century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human
body e g if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their
belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the fall
of adam by purifying the two parts of man s soul man could
be reunited with god in the fourteenth century these views underwent a major change william of ockham an oxford franciscan who died in one three four nine attacked the thomist view of compatibility between faith and reason his view widely accepted today was that god must be accepted on faith alone he could not be limited by human reason of course this
view was not incorrect if one accepted the postulate of a limitless god versus limited human reasoning capability but it virtually
erased alchemy from practice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries pope john xxii in the early one three zero zero s issued an edict against alchemy which effectively removed all church personnel from the practice of the art the climate changes black plague and increase in warfare and famine that characterized this century no doubt also served to hamper philosophical pursuits in general nicholas flamel had these mysterious alchemical symbols carved on his tomb in the church of the holy innocents in paris alchemy was kept alive by men such
as nicolas flamel who was noteworthy only because he was one of the few alchemists writing in those troubled times flamel lived from one three three zero to one four one seven and would serve as the archetype for the next phase of alchemy he was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher s stone which he is reputed to
have found his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosophers stone through the high middle ages one three zero zero one five zero zero alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone and the elixir of
youth now believed to be separate things their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art for example many alchemists during this period interpreted the purification of the soul to mean the transmutation of lead into gold in which they believed elemental mercury or quicksilver played a crucial role these men were viewed as magicians and sorcerers by many and were often
persecuted for their practices one of these men who emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century was named heinrich cornelius agrippa this alchemist believed himself to be a wizard and actually thought himself
capable of summoning spirits his influence was negligible but like flamel he produced writings which were referred to by alchemists of later years again like flamel he did much to change alchemy from a mystical philosophy to an occultist magic he did keep alive the philosophies of the
earlier alchemists including experimental science numerology etc but he added magic theory which reinforced the idea of alchemy as an occultist belief in spite of all this agrippa still considered himself a christian though his views often came into conflict with the church alchemy in the modern age and renaissance european alchemy continued in this way through the dawning of the renaissance the era also saw a flourishing of con artists who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to demonstrate the transmutation of
common metals into gold or claim to possess secret knowledge that with a small initial investment would surely lead to that goal the most important name in this period is philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim one four nine three one five four one who cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some
of the occultism that had accumulated over the years and promoting the use of observations and experiments to learn about the human body he rejected gnostic traditions but kept much of the hermetical neo platonic and pythagorean philosophies however hermetical science had so much aristotelian theory that his rejection of gnosticism was
practically meaningless in particular paracelsus rejected the magic theories of agrippa and flamel he did not think of himself as a magician and scorned those who did williams p two three nine four five paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and
silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that
sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner
that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them while his attempts of treating diseases with such remedies as mercury might seem ill advised from a modern point of view his basic idea of chemically produced medicines has stood time surprisingly well alchemik micha s dziw j oil on board by jan matejko seven three x one

in a submarine tycho brahe one five four six one six
zero one better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations was also an alchemist he had a laboratory built for that purpose at his uraniborg observatory research institute the decline of western alchemy the
demise of western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the one seven th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the one eight th century robert boyle one six two seven one six nine one better known for his studies of gases cf boyle s law pioneered the scientific method
in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data in a typical experiment boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding
of modern chemistry in the one eight th and one nine th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of
lavoisier and john dalton which finally provided a logical quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philospher s stone meanwhile paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body such as blood circulation harvey one six one six and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs
koch and pasteur one nine th century or lack of natural nutrients and vitamins lind eijkman funk et al supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles interpretive and prescriptive while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies thus as science
steadily continued to uncover and rationalize the clockwork of the
universe founded on its own materialistic metaphysics alchemy was left deprived of its chemical and medical connections but still incurably burdened by them reduced to an arcane philosophical system poorly connected to the material world it suffered the common fate of other esoteric disciplines such as astrology and kabbalah excluded from university curricula shunned by its former patrons ostracized by scientists and commonly viewed as the epitome of charlatanism and superstition these developments could be interpreted as part of a broader reaction
in european intellectualism against the romantic movement of the preceding century be as it may it is sobering to observe how a discipline that held so much intellectual and material prestige for more than two thousand years could disappear so easily from the universe of western thought modern alchemy in modern times progress has been made toward achieving the goals of alchemy using scientific rather than alchemic means these developments

dependent surveillance broadcast also called ads b is a system by which airplanes constantly broadcast their current position and altitude category of aircraft airspeed identification and whether the aircraft is turning climbing or descending over a dedicated radio datalink this functionality is known as ads b out and is the basic level of ads b functionality the ads b system was developed in the one nine nine zero s it relies on data from the global positioning system or any navigation system that provides an equivalent or better service the maximum range of the system is line
of sight typically less than two zero zero nautical miles three seven zero km the ads b transmissions are received by air traffic control stations and all other ads b equipped
aircraft within reception range reception by aircraft of ads b data is known as ads b in usage the initial use of ads b is expected to be by air traffic control and for surveillance purposes and for enhancing pilot situational awareness ads b is lower cost than conventional radar and permits higher quality surveillance of airborne and surface movements ads b is effective in
remote areas or in mountainous terrain where there is no radar coverage or where radar coverage is limited the outback of australia is one such area where ads b will provide surveillance where previously none existed ads b also enhances surveillance on the airport surface so it can also be used to monitor traffic on the taxiways and runways of an airport ads b equipped aircraft may also have a display unit in the cockpit picturing surrounding air traffic from ads b
data ads b in and tis b traffic information service broadcast data derived from air traffic radar both pilots and air traffic controllers will then be able
to see the positions of air traffic in the vicinity of the aircraft and this may be used to provide an asas airborne separation assurance system airborne collision avoidance
systems may in the future also make use of ads b in supplementing the existing tcas collision avoidance system by what is called hybrid surveillance airbus and boeing are now expected to include ads b out i e the transmitter of information as standard on new build aircraft from two zero zero five onwards this is in part due to the european requirements for mode s elementary surveillance which uses one zero
nine zero mhz mode s transponder which now is normally capable of ads b via extended squitter and some common functionality with ads b out addressed and broadcast ads the radio technical commission for aeronautics
rtca free flight selection committee defines surveillance as detection tracking characterization and observation of aircraft other vehicles and weather phenomena for the purpose of conducting flight operations in a safe and efficient manner automatic dependent surveillance ads is described as the process of creating and sending a message including the sender s current position and other surveillance information such as velocity intent and flight identification this information supports aircraft separation management by improving surveillance information at increased ranges situational awareness and decision making ads data can be used in cooperation with data from current radar
beacon systems such as air traffic control radar beacon systems atcrbs mode s traffic collision avoidance systems tcas and primary air traffic control atc radar and may also be used as a sole means of surveillance
there are two commonly recognized types of ads for aircraft applications ads addressed ads
a also known as ads contract ads c and ads broadcast ads b ads a provides a surveillance data report that is sent to a specific addressee for example ads a reports are employed in the future air navigation system fans using the aircraft communication addressing and reporting system acars as the communication protocol during transoceanic flight reports are periodically sent by an aircraft to the controlling
air traffic region when ads b is used aircraft and other vehicles continuously broadcast a message including position heading velocity and intent other uses may include obstacles transmitting a position message aircraft ground based stations and other users monitoring the channels can receive the information and use it in a wide variety of applications because of this potential for broad utilization a
system using ads b is most often discussed as a replacement for or an augmentation to current methods of monitoring aeronautical traffic to understand the full capability of ads b consider how the current air traffic control system creates information the radar measures the range and bearing of an aircraft bearing is measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives a response to its interrogation from the aircraft and range is measured by the time it takes for the
radar to receive the interrogation response the antenna beam becomes wider as the aircraft get farther away making
the position information less accurate additionally detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart in contrast a system using ads b creates
and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft these reports are generated and distributed
using precise instruments such as the global positioning system gps and mode s transponders meaning integrity of the data is no longer susceptible to the range of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps the enhanced accuracy of the information will be used to improve safety support a wide variety of applications and increase airport and airspace capacity use of ads b for ground based surveillance requires only ads b out transmit capability on the
aircraft with the addition of ads b in receive capability the potential for ads b applications grows significantly some of the equipment and services associated with ads b in capability include cockpit display of traffic information cdti
a display of proximate traffic based on ads b reports from other aircraft and ground based facilities traffic information services broadcast tis b a ground based uplink report of proximate traffic that is under surveillance by atc but is
not ads b equipped this service would be available even with limited ads b implementation flight information services broadcast fis b a ground based uplink of flight information services and weather data ads b physical layer three link solutions are being proposed as the physical layer for relaying the ads
b position reports one zero nine zero mhz mode s extended squitter es universal access transceiver uat and vhf digital link vdl mode four mode s the faa has announced its selection of the one zero nine zero mhz es and uat as the mediums for the ads b system in the united
states one zero nine zero mhz es will be the primary medium for air carrier and high performance commercial aircraft while uat will be the primary medium for general aviation aircraft europe has also chosen one zero nine zero mhz as the primary physical layer for ads b however the second medium has not yet been selected between uat and vdl mode four with one zero nine zero es the existing mode s transponder or a stand alone one zero nine zero mhz transmitter supports a message type known as the es message it is a
periodic message that provides position velocity heading time and in the future intent the basic es does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data called trajectory change points to enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message the transponder is modified and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder atc ground stations and tcas equipped aircraft already
have the necessary one zero nine zero mhz receivers to receive these signals and would only require enhancements to accept and process the additional information one zero nine zero es will not support fis b due to regulatory requirements universal access transceiver the
uat system is specifically designed for ads b operation a one mhz channel in the nine zero
zero mhz frequency range is dedicated for transmission of airborne ads b reports and for broadcast of ground based aeronautical information uat users would have access to the additional ground based aeronautical data and would receive reports from proximate traffic fis b and tis b vdl mode four the vdl mode four system could utilize one or more of the existing aeronautical vhf frequencies as the radio frequency physical layer for ads b transmissions vdl mode four uses a protocol stdma that allows it to be self organizing meaning no
master ground station is required this medium is best used for short message transmissions from a large number of users vdl mode four systems are capable of increased
range in comparison to l band mode s one zero nine zero mhz or
uat systems implementation timetable the timetable for airborne ads b equipage will be determined by
ground and airborne facility implementation equipment cost perceived benefits of equipping and regulatory actions by the civil aviation authorities caa the cost to equip with ads b out capability is relatively small and would benefit the airspace by enabling increased situational awareness ads b in capability can provide additional benefits when ground stations and the critical mass of aircraft are also equipped this data was taken into consideration when building the following estimated implementation timetable near term implementation two zero
zero six two zero zero eight the next three years will see a continuation of ads b trials and some implementation in pockets where limited aircraft equipage can bring operational benefits some of these include capstone in alaska the faa is conducting its capstone program to improve surveillance in some of the more remote
locations of alaska and as a test bed for implementing elements of ads b into the atc environment approximately one nine zero general aviation users have been equipped with gps receivers uat transceivers and flight deck displays in addition one one ground based transceivers have been installed for radar like services and flight information services data fis b including weather information is being uplinked from the ground phase ii of the
program will expand the coverage and add more than two five zero additional users gulf of mexico in the gulf of mexico where atc radar coverage is incomplete the faa is locating ads b one zero nine zero mhz receivers on oil rigs and buoys to relay information received from aircraft equipped with ads b extended squitters back to the atc centers to expand and improve surveillance coverage australia australia is implementing ads b trials in queensland
to test the feasibility of one zero nine zero mhz ads b as an alternative to ground based radar ads b is expected to be a much more cost effective method of providing atc surveillance coverage for remote areas which currently have limited or no surveillance coverage cargo airline association cargo carriers operating at their hub airports operate
largely at night equipage of these aircraft with ads b and cdti displays along with a ground based transceiver at these hubs will allow better situational awareness at night and in inclement weather and offers the potential for increased airport traffic handling capability embry riddle aeronautical university embry riddle aeronautical university is equipping the training aircraft at its two main campuses in florida and arizona with ads b capability as a

with the start of ground based ads b infrastructure will begin to make a number of ads b applications attractive benefits of pockets of implementation will become evident
and these areas will be expanded encouraging more users to equip with ads b capability beginning in two zero zero four the faa is expected
to deploy ads b ground infrastructure based on asde x equipment this infrastructure will allow the use of ads b data for atc purposes such as surface
movement tracking guidance and airborne surveillance ground uplinks of tis b and fis b will commence where the ground infrastructure is deployed other civil aviation authorities may install ads b ground infrastructure and require aircraft to be equipped with ads b out for operation in selected airspace australia is expected to be the first country to do so however a number of other countries with limited surveillance coverage may find ads
b an attractive alternative to radar surveillance significant numbers of users will become equipped with a minimum of ads b out capability in europe one zero nine zero mhz es will become standard capability for all new mode s transponder installations after three one march two zero zero five uat will become increasingly popular in the upper end of the general aviation market airport situational awareness a combination of detailed airport maps airport multilateration asde x systems enhanced aircraft displays and ads b have the potential

the capital is the city of vienna austria is a parliamentary representative democracy consisting of nine
federal states and is one of two european countries that have declared their everlasting neutrality the other being switzerland austria is a member of the united nations since one nine five five and the european union since one nine nine five for the first half of two zero zero six austria holds the seat of the presidency of the eu origin and history of the name the german name sterreich can be translated into english as the eastern realm which is derived from the old german ostarr chi reich can also mean empire and this connotation is the one that
is understood in the context of the austrian austro hungarian empire holy roman empire although not in the context of the modern republic of sterreich the term probably originates in a vernacular translation of the medieval latin name for the region marchia orientalis which translates as eastern border as it was situated at the eastern edge of the holy roman empire that was also mirrored in the name ostmark applied after anschluss to germany history
austria and the holy roman empire the territory of austria originally known as the celtic kingdom of noricum was a long time ally of rome it was occupied rather than conquered by the romans during the reign of augustus and made the province noricum in one six bc later it was conquered by huns rugii lombards ostrogoths bavarii avars until c eight zero zero and franks
in that order finally after four eight years of hungarian rule nine zero seven to nine five five the core territory of austria was awarded to leopold of babenberg in nine seven six being part of the holy roman empire the babenbergs ruled and expanded austria from the one zero th century to the one three th century battle of vienna one six eight three after duke frederick ii died in one two four six and left no successor rudolf i of habsburg gave the lands to his sons marking the beginning of
the line of the habsburgs who continued to govern austria until the two zero th century with the short exception of charles vii albert of bavaria austrian habsburgs held the position of german emperor beginning in one four three eight with albert ii of habsburg until the
end of the holy roman empire during the one four th and one five th century austria continued to expand its territory until it reached the position of a european imperial power at the end of the one five
th century until the end of the habsburg monarchy in one nine one eight modern history just two years before the abolition of the holy roman empire in one eight zero six in one eight zero four the empire of austria was founded which was transformed in one eight six seven into the dual monarchy
austria hungary the empire was split into several independent states in one nine one eight after the defeat of the central powers in world war i with most of the german speaking parts becoming a republic see treaty of saint germain between one nine one eight and one nine one nine it was officially known as the
republic of german austria republik deutsch sterreich after the entente powers forbade german austria to unite with germany they also forbade the name and then it was changed to simply republic of austria the democratic republic lasted until one nine three three when the chancellor engelbert dollfu established an autocratic regime oriented towards italian fascism austrofascism austria became part of germany in one nine three eight through the anschlu and remained under nazi rule until the end of world
war ii after the defeat of the axis powers the allies occupied austria until one nine five
five when the country became a fully independent republic under the condition that it would remain neutral see austrian state treaty austria also became a member of the un in the same year after the collapse of communist states in eastern europe austria became increasingly involved in european affairs and in one nine nine five austria joined the european union and the euro monetary system in one nine nine
nine politics austrian parliament in vienna austria became a federal parliamentarian democratic republic through the federal constitution of one nine two zero it was reintroduced in one nine four five to the nine states of the federal republic the head of state is the federal president who is directly elected the chairman of the federal government is the federal chancellor who is appointed by the president the government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by vote of no confidence in the lower chamber of parliament the nationalrat the parliament of austria consists of two
chambers the composition of the nationalrat is determined every four years by a free general election in which every citizen is allowed to vote to fill its one eight three seats a four percent hurdle prevents a large splintering of the political landscape in the nationalrat by awarding seats only to political parties that have obtained at least a four percent threshold of the general vote or alternatively have won a direct seat or direktmandat in one of the four
three regional election districts the nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in austria however the upper house of parliament the bundesrat has a limited right of veto the nationalrat can in most cases pass the respective bill a second time bypassing the bundesrat altogether a convention called the sterreich konvent was convened in june three zero two zero zero three to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution but has failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the nationalrat necessary for constitutional
amendments and or reform however some important parts of the
final report were generally agreed upon and are still expected to be implemented subdivisions a federal republic austria is divided into nine states german bundesl nder these states are divided into districts bezirke and cities statutarst dte districts are subdivided into municipalities gemeinden cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities the states are not mere administrative divisions but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government states of

into five different areas the biggest area are the austrian alps which constitute six two of austria s total area the austrian foothills at the base of the alps and the carpathians account for around one two of its area the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the pannoni low country amount to about one two of the total landmass the second greater mountain area much lower than the alps is situated in the north known as the austrian granite plateau it is located in the central area of the bohemian mass and accounts for
one zero of austria the austrian portion of the viennese basin comprises the remaining four climate the greater part of austria lies in the cool temperate climate zone in which humid westerly winds predominate with over half of the country dominated by the alps the alpine climate is the predominant one in the east the climate shows continental features with less rain than the areas with high rainfall averages the six highest mountains in austria are economy the belvedere palace an example of the baroque
austria has a well developed social market economy and a high standard of living until the one nine eight zero s many of austria s largest industry firms were nationalised however in recent years privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other european economies labour movements are particularly strong in austria and have large influence on labour politics germany has historically been the main trading partner of austria making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the german economy slow growth in germany and elsewhere in the world affected
austria slowing its growth to one two in two zero zero one but since austria became a member state of the european union
it has gained closer ties to other european union economies reducing its economic dependence on germany in addition membership in the eu has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by austria s access to the single european market and proximity to eu aspiring economies therefore estimates of growth in two zero zero five up to two are much more favourable than in the crippling german economy agriculture austrian farms like those of other west european mountainous countries are small and fragmented and production is relatively expensive industry although some industries such as several iron
and steel works and chemical plants are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people most industrial and commercial enterprises in austria are relatively small on an international scale services like in other western countries the biggest contributor to austria s gdp is its service sector most notably is tourism especially winter tourism to meet increased competition from both eu and central european countries austria will need

to the development of many distinct german dialects all of the dialects in the country however belong to austro bavarian groups of german dialects with the exception of the dialect spoken in its west most bundesland vorarlberg which belongs to the group of alemannic dialects there is also a distinct grammatical standard for austrian german with a few differences to the german spoken in germany politics concerning ethnic groups volksgruppenpolitik an estimated two five zero zero zero four zero zero zero zero slovenians in the austrian state of carinthia
as well as croatians and hungarians in burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the austrian state treaty staatsvertrag of one nine five five the slovenians in the austrian state of styria estimated at a number between one six zero zero and five zero zero zero are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights although the state treaty of july two seven one nine five five states otherwise the right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where slovene and croatian speaking austrians live alongside with the german speaking
population as required by the one nine five five state treaty is still to be fully implemented there is also an undercurrent of thinking amongst parts of the carenthian population that the slovenian involvement in the partisan
war against the nazi occupation force was a bad thing and indeed tito partisan is a not an infrequent insult hurled against members of the minority many carinthians are afraid of slovenian territorial claims pointing to the fact that yugoslav troops entered the
state after each of the two world wars and considering that some official slovenian atlases still show parts of carinthia as slovenian cultural territory the current governor j rg haider has made this fact a matter of public argument in fall two zero zero five by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in carinthia a poll by the k rntner humaninstitut
conducted in january two zero zero six states that six five of carinthians are not in favour of
an increase of bilingual topographic signs since the original requirements set by the state treaty of one nine five five have already been fulfilled according to their point of view another interesting phenomenon is the so called windischen theorie stating that the slovenians can be split in two groups actual slovenians and windische based on differences in language between austrian slovenians who were taught slovenian standard language in school and those slovenians who spoke their local slovenian dialect but went to german schools to the latter
group the term windische originally the german word for slovenians was applied claiming that they were a different ethnic group this theory was never generally accepted and has been ultimately rejected several decades ago list of cities in austria religion charles v austrian habsburg ruler and one of the major figures within the counter reformation while northern and central germany was the origin of the reformation austria and bavaria were the heart of the counter
reformation in the one six th and one seven th century when the absolute monarchy of habsburg imposed a strict regime to maintain catholicism s power and influence among austrians despite this establishment of catholicism as the predominant christian religion protestants have throughout austria s history remained a relatively small group austria s history as a multinational state has made
it necessary for habsburg rulers to deal with a heterogeneous religious population religious freedom was declared a constitutional right as early as one eight six seven and austria hungary was home of numerous religions beside roman catholicism such as greek serbian romanian russian and
bulgarian orthodox christians jews muslims austria neighboured the ottoman empire for centuries mormons and both calvinists and lutheran protestants still austria remained largely influenced by catholicism after one nine one eight first republic catholic leaders such as theodor innitzer and ignaz seipel took leading positions within or close to the austrian government and increased their influence during the time of
the austrofascism catholicism was treated much like a state religion by dictators engelbert dollfuss and kurt schuschnigg although catholic leaders welcomed the germans in one nine three eight during the anschluss of austria into germany austrian catholicism stopped its support of nazism later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the third reich after one nine four five a
stricter secularism was imposed in austria and religious influence on politics has nearly vanished as of the end of the two zero th century about seven three of austria s population are registered as roman catholic while about five consider themselves protestants both these numbers have been on the decline for decades especially roman catholicism which has suffered an increasing number of seceders of the church this is due partly to child sexual abuse scandals by priests as well as the alleged unwillingness of the roman catholic church to implement reforms in addition austrian catholics are obliged to
pay a mandatory tax calculated by income ca one to the austrian roman catholic church which acts as another incentive to leave the church about one two of the population declare that they do not belong to any church or religious community of the remaining people about one eight zero zero zero zero are members of the eastern orthodox church and about seven three zero zero are jewish it has to be noted that the austrian jewish community of one nine three eight vienna alone counted more than two zero zero zero zero zero of

two five the united kingdom formally claimed the western part of australia in one eight two nine separate colonies were created from parts of new south wales south australia in one
eight three six victoria in one eight five one and queensland in one eight five nine the northern territory nt was founded in one eight six three as part of the province of south australia victoria and south australia were founded as free colonies that is they were never penal colonies although the former did receive some convicts from tasmania western australia was also founded free
but later accepted transported convicts due to an acute labour shortage the transportation of convicts to australia was phased out between one eight four zero
and one eight six eight the indigenous australian population estimated at about three five zero zero zero zero at the time of european settlement declined steeply for one five zero years following settlement mainly due to infectious disease forced migration the removal of children and other colonial government policies that some historians and indigenous australians have argued could be considered tantamount to genocide by today s understanding such interpretations of aboriginal history are disputed by some as being exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons this debate is known within australia as the history wars following
the one nine six seven referendum the federal government gained the power to implement policies and make laws with respect to aborigines traditional ownership of land native title was not recognised until the high court case mabo v queensland no two overturned the notion of australia as terra nullius at the time of european occupation the last post is played at an anzac day ceremony in port melbourne victoria two five april two zero

the northern territory was transferred from the control of the south australian government to the commonwealth in one nine one one australia willingly participated in
world war i many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps anzacs at gallipoli as the birth of the nation its first major military action the gallipoli campaign is often erroneously portrayed as or conceived to have been a solely or mainly anzac campaign the reality was that british deaths during the campaign were twice as high as
those of anzac forces much like gallipoli the kokoda track campaign is regarded by many as a nation defining battle from world war ii the statute of westminster one nine three one formally ended most of the constitutional links between australia and the united kingdom but australia did not adopt the statute until one nine four two the shock of the united kingdom s defeat in asia in one nine four two and the threat of japanese invasion caused australia to turn to the united states as a new ally and protector since one nine five
one australia has been a formal military ally of the us under the auspices of the anzus treaty after world war ii australia encouraged mass immigration from europe since the one nine seven zero s and the abolition of the white australia policy immigration from asia and other parts of the world was also encouraged as a result australia s demography culture and image of
itself were radically transformed the final constitutional ties between australia and the united kingdom ended in one nine eight six with the passing of the australia act one nine eight six ending any british role in the australian states and ending judicial appeals to the uk privy council australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in one nine nine nine by a five five majority but the result is generally viewed in terms of dissatisfaction with the specifics of the
proposed republican model rather than attachment to the monarchy since the election of the whitlam government in one nine seven two there has been an increasing focus on the nation s future as a part of the asia pacific region politics
new parliament house in canberra was opened in one nine eight eight replacing the provisional parliament house building opened in one nine two seven the commonwealth of australia is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of government queen elizabeth ii is the queen
of australia a role that is distinct from her position as elizabeth ii of the united kingdom the queen is nominally represented by the governor general although the constitution gives extensive executive powers to the governor general
these are normally exercised only on the advice of the prime minister the most notable exercise of the governor general s reserve powers outside the prime minister s direction was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of one nine seven five there are three branches of government the legislature the commonwealth parliament comprising the queen the senate and the house of representatives the queen is represented by the governor general who in
practice exercises little or no power over the parliament the executive the federal executive council the governor general as advised by the executive councillors in practice the councillors are the prime minister and ministers of state whose advice the governor general accepts with rare exceptions the judiciary the high court of australia and other federal courts the state courts became formally independent from
the judicial committee of the privy council when the australia act was passed in one nine eight six the
bicameral commonwealth parliament consists of the queen the senate the upper house of seven six senators and a house of representatives the lower house of one five zero members members of the lower house are elected from single member constituencies commonly known as electorates or seats seats in the house of representatives are allocated to states on the basis of population in the senate each state regardless of population is represented by one
two senators with the act and the nt each electing two elections for both chambers are held every three years typically only half of the senate seats are put to each election because senators have overlapping six year terms the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms government with its leader becoming prime minister there are three major political parties the labor party the liberal
party and the national party independent members and several minor parties including the greens family first and the australian democrats have achieved representation in australian parliaments mostly in upper houses although
their influence has been marginal since the one nine nine six election the liberal national coalition led by the prime minister john howard has been in power in canberra in the two zero zero four election the coalition won control of the senate the first time that a party or coalition of governing parties has done so while in government in more than two zero years the labor party is in power in every state and

states are new south wales queensland south australia tasmania victoria and
western australia the two major mainland territories are the northern territory and the australian
capital territory in most respects the territories function similarly to the states but the commonwealth parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments by contrast federal legislation overrides state legislation only with respect to certain areas as set out in section five one of the constitution all residual legislative powers are retained by the state parliaments including powers over hospitals education police the judiciary roads public transport and local government each state and territory has its own legislature unicameral in
the case of the northern territory the act and queensland and bicameral in the remaining states the lower house is known as the legislative assembly house of assembly in south australia and

the egyptians also had an emphasis on observations of the sky mixtures of religious interpretations of the sky and the development of complex models for applying these interpretations led to a duality that we now identify as astrology it is important to recognize that
before about one seven five zero there was no distinction between astrology and astronomy astronomers unlike most scientists cannot interact with the objects that
they study they instead must resort to detailed observation in
order to make discoveries generally astronomers use telescopes or other imaging equipment to make such observations the job itself is involved with travel to remote locations to study as well famous astronomers see also amateur

some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid for instance our white blood cells which consume pathogens many protists exist as individual amoeboid cells or take such a form at some point in their life cycle the most
famous such organism is amoeba proteus the name amoebae is variously used to describe its close relatives other organisms similar to it or the amoeboids in general amoeboids may be
divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of the pseudopods those where the pseudopods are supported by regular arrays of microtubules are called actinopods and forms where they are not are called rhizopods further divided into lobse filose and reticulose amoebae there is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids the xenophyophores that do not fall into any of these categories lobose pseudopods are blunt and there may be one or several on a cell which is usually divided into a layer of clear ectoplasm
surrounding more granular endoplasm most including amoeba itself move by the body mass flowing into
an anterior pseudopod the vast majority form a monophyletic group called the amoebozoa which also includes most slime moulds a second group the percolozoa includes protists that can transform between amoeboid and flagellate forms filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering the vast
majority of filose amoebae including all those that produce shells are placed within the cercozoa together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid
forms the naked filose amoebae comprise two other groups the vampyrellids and nucleariids the latter appear to be close relatives of animals and fungi reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net they are found most notably among the foraminifera a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi chambered shells there are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids notably the gymnophryids and their relationships are not certain actinopods are divided into the radiolaria and heliozoa the radiolaria are mostly marine protists with complex internal skeletons including central capsules that divide the
cells into granular endoplasm and frothy ectoplasm that keeps them buoyant the heliozoa include both freshwater and marine forms that use their
axopods to capture small prey and only have simple scales or spines for skeletal elements both groups appear to be polyphyletic traditionally the amoeboid protozoa are grouped together as the sarcodina variously ranked from class to phylum with each of
the above categories as a formal subtaxon however since they are all based on form rather than phylogeny newer systems generally separate some out or abandon them entirely most amoeboids are now included in two major supergroups the amoebozoa including most lobose amoebae and slime
moulds and the rhizaria including the cercozoa foraminifera radiolarian classes and certain heliozoa however amoeboids have appeared separately in many other groups including various different lines of algae not listed above external links the amoebae website brings together information from published sources amoebas are more than just blobs sun animacules and amoebas protistacell biologyamoeboidsmotile cells there are nine five printable ascii characters numbered three two to one two six ascii a merican s tandard c ode for i nformation i nterchange generally pronounced is a character encoding based on the english alphabet ascii codes represent text in computers communications
equipment and other devices that work with text most modern character encodings have a historical basis in ascii ascii was first published as a standard in one nine six seven and was last updated in one nine eight six it currently defines codes for three three non printing mostly obsolete control characters that affect how text is processed plus the
following nine five printable characters starting with the space character abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz asteroid three five six eight ascii is named after the character encoding overview like other character representation computer codes ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and the symbols glyphs of a written language thus allowing digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information the
ascii character encoding or a compatible extension see below is used on nearly all common computers especially personal computers and workstations the preferred mime name for this encoding is us ascii ascii is strictly a seven bit code meaning that it uses the bit patterns representable with seven binary digits a range of
zero to one two seven decimal to represent character information at the time ascii was introduced many computers dealt with eight bit groups bytes or more specifically octets as the smallest unit of information the eighth bit was commonly used as a parity bit for error checking on communication lines or other device specific functions machines which did not use parity typically set the eighth bit to zero though some systems such
as prime machines running primos set the eighth bit of ascii characters to one ascii only defines a relationship between specific characters and bit sequences aside from reserving a few control codes for line oriented formatting it does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document such concepts are within the realm of other systems such as the markup languages history ascii developed from telegraphic codes and first
entered commercial use as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services the bell system had previously planned to use a six bit code derived from fieldata that added punctuation and lower case letters to the earlier five bit baudot teleprinter code but was persuaded instead to join the asa subcommittee that had started to develop ascii baudot helped in the automation of sending and receiving telegraphic messages and took many features from morse code however unlike morse code baudot used constant length codes compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed
bell code and ascii both underwent re ordering for more convenient sorting especially alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence the american standards association asa later to become ansi first published ascii as a standard in one nine six three ascii one nine six three lacked the lowercase letters and had an up arrow instead of the caret and a left arrow instead of the underscore the one nine six seven version added the lowercase letters changed the names
of a few control characters and moved the two controls ack and esc from the lowercase letters area into the control codes area ascii was subsequently updated and published as ansi x three four one nine six eight ansi x three four one nine seven
seven and finally ansi x three four one nine eight six other international standards bodies
have ratified character encodings that are identical or nearly identical to ascii these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii even though ascii is strictly defined only by the asa ansi standards the european computer manufacturers association published editions of its ascii clone ecma six in one nine six five one nine six seven one nine seven zero one nine seven three one nine eight three and one nine nine one
the one nine nine one edition is the same as ansi x three four one nine eight six the international organization for standardization published its version iso six four six later iso iec six four six in one nine six seven one nine seven two one nine eight three and one nine nine one iso six four six one nine seven two in particular established a set
of country specific versions with punctuation characters replaced with non english letters iso iec six four six one nine nine one international reference version is the same as ansi x three four one nine eight six the international telecommunication union published its version of ansi x three four one nine eight six itu t recommendation t five zero in one nine nine two in the early one nine seven zero s under the

one nine eight six with the publication of rfc one three four five in one nine nine two ibm s version of ansi x three four one nine eight six is published in ibm technical literature as code page three six seven ascii has also become embedded in its probable replacement unicode as the lowest one two eight characters some observers consider ascii the most successful software standard
ever promulgated ascii control characters ascii reserves the first three two codes numbers zero three one decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to carry printable information but rather to control devices such
as printers that make use of ascii for example character one zero represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character two seven represents the escape key often found in the top left corner of common keyboards code one two seven all seven bits on another special character equates to delete or rubout though its function resembles that of other control characters the designers of ascii used
this pattern so that it could erase a section of paper tape a popular storage medium until the one nine eight zero s by punching all possible holes at a particular character position thus effectively replacing any previous information since code zero null
all bits off was also ignored it was possible to leave gaps and then make corrections by blanking characters before or after the gap and then entering new characters in the gap many of the ascii control codes serve or served to mark data packets or to control a data transmission protocol e g enquiry effectively any stations out there acknowledge negative acknowledge start of header start of text end of text etc escape and substitute permit a communications protocol to for instance mark binary data so that if
it contains codes with the same pattern as a protocol character the recipient will process the code as data the designers of ascii intended the separator characters record separator etc for use with magnetic tape systems two of the device control characters commonly interpreted as xon and xoff generally function as flow control
characters to throttle data flow to a slow device such as a printer from a fast device such as a computer so data does not overrun and get lost early users of ascii adopted some of the control codes to represent meta information such as end of line start end of a data element and so on these assignments often conflict so part of the effort in converting data from one format to another involves making the correct meta information transformations for
example the character s representing end of line newline in text data files streams vary from operating system to operating system when moving files from one system to another the conversion process must recognize these characters as end of line markers and handle them appropriately today
ascii users use the control characters less and less with the exception of carriage return and or line feed modern markup languages modern communication protocols the move from text based to graphical devices and the demise of teleprinters punch cards and paper tapes have rendered most of the control characters obsolete printable representation the
unicode glyphs reserved for representing control characters when it is necessary to print or display them rather than have them perform their intended function control key sequence the traditional key sequences for inputting control characters the caret represents the
control or ctrl key that must be held down while pressing the second key in
the sequence the caret key representation is also used by some software to represent control
characters the backspace character can also be entered by pressing the
backspace bksp or key on some systems the delete character can also be entered by pressing the delete or del key it can also be entered by
pressing the backspace bksp or key on some systems the escape character can also be entered by pressing the escape or esc key on some systems the carriage return
character can also be entered by pressing the return ret enter or key on most systems the ambiguity surrounding the backspace key comes from systems that translated the del control
character into a bs backspace before transmitting it some software was unable to process the character and would display h instead h persists in messages today as a deliberate humorous device e g there s a sucker h h h h h hpotential customer born every minute a less common variant of this involves the use of w which in some text editors means delete previous
word the example sentence would therefore also work as there s a
sucker w potential customer born every minute ascii printable characters code three two the space character denotes the space between words as produced by
the large space bar of a keyboard codes three three to one two six known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation
marks and a few miscellaneous symbols seven bit ascii provided seven national characters and if the combined hardware and software permit can use overstrikes to simulate some additional international characters in such a scenario a backspace
can precede a grave accent which the american and british standards but only those standards also call opening single quotation mark a tilde or a breath mark inverted vel zero one one one one one one zero one two six seven e structural
features the digits zero nine are represented with their values in binary prefixed with zero zero one one this means that bcd ascii is simply a matter of taking each bcd nibble separately and prefixing zero zero one one to it lowercase and uppercase letters only differ in bit pattern by a single bit simplifying case conversion to a range test to avoid converting characters that are not letters and a single bitwise operation aliases for ascii rfc one three four five published
in june one nine nine two and the iana registry of character sets ongoing both recognize the following case insensitive aliases
for ascii as suitable for use on the internet ansi x three four one nine six eight canonical name ansi x three four one nine eight six ascii us ascii preferred mime name us iso six four six us iso six four six irv one nine nine one iso ir six ibm three six seven cp three six seven csascii
of these only the aliases us ascii and ascii have achieved widespread use one often finds them in
the optional charset parameter in the content type header of some mime messages in the equivalent meta element of some html documents and in the encoding declaration part of the prolog of some
xml documents variants of ascii as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii in order
to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some mis apply that term to cover all variants including those that do not preserve ascii s character map in the seven bit range iso six four six one nine seven two the first attempt to remedy the pro english language bias created compatibility problems since it remained a seven bit character set it made no additional codes available so it reassigned some in language specific variants it thus became impossible to
know what character a code represented without knowing which variant to work with and text processing systems could generally cope with only one variant anyway eventually improved technology brought out of band means to represent the information formerly encoded in the eighth bit of each byte freeing this bit to add another one two eight additional character codes for new assignments for example ibm developed eight bit code pages such as code page four three seven which replaced the control
characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper one two eight bytes operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware eight bit standards such as iso iec eight eight five nine and mac os roman developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact and just adding additional values above the seven bit range this enabled the representation of a broader range of languages but these standards
continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations still iso eight eight five nine one its variant windows one two five two often mislabeled as iso eight eight five nine one and original seven bit ascii remain the most common character encodings in use today unicode and the iso iec one zero six four six universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec eight eight five nine and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii basically uses seven bit codes unicode and
the ucs use relatively abstract code points non negative integer numbers that map using different encoding forms and schemes to sequences of one or more eight bit bytes to permit backward compatibility unicode and the ucs assign the first one two eight code points to the same characters as ascii one can therefore think of ascii as a seven bit encoding
scheme for a very small subset of unicode and of the ucs the popular utf eight encoding form prescribes the use of one to four eight bit code values for each code point character and equates exactly to ascii for the code values below one
two eight other encoding forms such as utf one six resemble ascii in how they represent the first one two eight characters of unicode but tend to use one six or three two bits per character so they require conversion for compatibility the blend word asciibetical has evolved to describe the collation of data in ascii code order rather
than standard alphabetical order the abbreviation asciiz or asciz refers to a null terminated ascii string see also ansi ascii art ascii games text file bob bemer ebcdic unicode ascii ribbon ascii extensions where all ascii printable characters are identical to ascii extended ascii utf eight iso eight eight five nine iscii viscii windows code pages ascii variants where some ascii printable characters have been replaced iso six

leo africanus one four nine five one five five four attributed the origin to the greek word phrike meaning cold and horror combined with the negating prefix
a so meaning a land free of cold and horror however the change of sound from ph to f in greek is datable to about the first century so this is unlikely to be the origin ancient africa extended into what is now known as asia there was no line drawn between the two continents until the geographer ptolemy eight five one

civilizations include ethiopia the nubian kingdom carthage the kingdoms of the sahel ghana mali and songhai and great zimbabwe in one four eight two the portuguese established the first of many trading stations along the guinea coast at
elmina the chief commodities dealt in were slaves gold ivory and spices the european discovery of america in
one four nine two was followed by a great development of the slave trade which before the portuguese era had been an overland trade almost exclusively and never confined to any one continent but at the same time that slavery was ending in europe in the early one nine th century the european imperial powers staged a massive scramble for africa and occupied most of the continent creating many colonial nation states and leaving only two independent nations liberia the black american colony and ethiopia this occupation continued until after the conclusion
of the second world war when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence today africa is home to over five zero independent countries all but two of which still have the borders drawn up during the era of european colonialism politics map showing european claimants to the african continent at the beginning of world war i precolonial africa colonial africa colonialism had a destabilizing effect on what had been a number of ethnic groups that is still being felt in african politics
prior to european influence national borders were not much of a concern with africans generally following the practice of other areas of the world such as the arabian peninsula where a group s territory was congruent with its military or trade influence the european insistence of drawing borders around territories to isolate them from those of other colonial powers often had the effect of separating otherwise contiguous political groups or forcing traditional enemies to live side by side
with no buffer between them for example the congo river although it appears to be a natural geographic boundary had groups that
otherwise shared a language culture or other similarity who resided on both sides the division of the land between belgium and france along the river isolated these groups from each other those who lived in saharan or sub saharan africa and traded across the continent for centuries often found themselves crossing borders that existed only on european maps in nations that had substantial european populations for example rhodesia and south africa systems of second class citizenship were often set up
in order to give europeans political power far in excess of their numbers however the lines were not often drawn strictly across racial lines in liberia the citizens who were descendants of american slaves managed to have a political system for over one zero zero years that gave ex slaves and natives to the area roughly equal legislative power despite the fact the ex slaves
were outnumbered ten to one in the general population the inspiration for this system was the united states senate which had balanced the power of free and slave states despite the much larger population of the former europeans often changed the balance of power created ethnic divides where they did not previously exist and introduced a cultural dichotomy detrimental to the native
inhabitants in the areas they controlled for example in what is now rwanda and burundi two ethnic groups hutus and tutsis had merged into one culture by the time belgian colonists had taken control of the region in the one nine th century no longer
divided by ethnicity as intermingling inter marriage and merging of cultural practices over the centuries had long since erased visible signs of a culture divide the belgians instituted a policy of racial categorization upon taking control of the region as racial
based categorization and philosophies was a fixture of the european culture of that time the term hutu originally referred to the agricultural based bantu
speaking tribes that moved into present day rwandan and burundi from the west and the term tutsi
referred to north eastern cattle based tribes that migrated into the region later the terms to the indigenous peoples eventually came to describe a person s economic class those individuals who owned roughly one zero or more cattle were considered tutsi and those with fewer were considered hutu regardless of ancestral history this was not a strict line but a general rule of thumb and one could move from hutu to tutsi and vice versa the belgians introduced a racialised system those individuals who had characteristics the europeans admired fairer skin ample height narrow noses etc were given power
amongst the colonized peoples the belgians determined these features were more ideally hamitic hamitic in turn being more ideally european and belonged to those people closest to tutsi in ancestry they instituted a policy of issuing identity cards based on this philosophy those closest to this ideal were proclaimed tutsi and those not were proclaimed hutu post colonial africa since independence african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african nations are republics that operate
under some form of the presidential system of rule few nations in africa have been able to sustain democratic governments instead cycling through a series of brutal coups and military dictatorships a number of africa s post colonial political leaders were poorly educated and ignorant on matters of governance great instability however was mainly the result of marginalization of other ethnic groups and graft under these leaders as well many used the positions of power
to ignite ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated or even created under colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and ruled most nations in
africa during the seven zero s and early eight zero s during the period from the early one nine six zero s to the late one nine eight zero s africa had over seven zero coups and one three presidential assassinations cold war conflicts between the united states and the soviet union also played a role in the instability when a country became independent for the first time it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid while many
in central and southern africa were supported by the united states and or france
the one nine seven zero s saw an escalation as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence border and territorial disputes have also been common with the european imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts failed government policies and political corruption have also resulted in many widespread famines and significant portions of africa remain with distribution systems unable to disseminate enough food or water for the population to survive the spread of disease is also rampant especially the
spread of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the associated acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids which has become a deadly epidemic on the continent despite numerous hardships there have been some signs the continent has hope for the future democratic governments seem to be spreading though are not yet the majority national
geographic claims one three african nations can be considered truly democratic as well many nations have at least nominally recognized basic human rights for all citizens though in practice these are not always recognized and have created reasonably independent judiciaries there are clear signs of increased networking among african organisations and states in the civil war in the democratic republic of congo former zaire rather than rich non african countries intervening about half a dozen neighbouring african countries got involved
see also second congo war the death toll has been estimated by some to be three five million since the conflict began in one nine nine eight this might play a role similar to that of world war ii for europe after which the people in the neighbouring countries decide to integrate their societies in such a way that war between them becomes as unthinkable as a war between say france and germany would be today political associations such as the african union are also offering hope for greater co operation and peace between the continent s many countries extensive
human rights abuses still occur in several parts of africa often under the oversight of the state most of such violations occur for political reasons often times as a side effect of civil war countries where major human rights
violations have been reported in recent times include the democratic republic of the congo sierra leone liberia sudan and c te d ivoire modern africa most western countries place limitations on aid to african nations especially the united states these limitations are often used to control the governments of these african nations as a result these nations are turning to non traditional sources of financial aid china has increasingly provided financial aid to africa in order to secure contracts on natural resources such as oil gold and diamonds there usually is
no political prescription countries the chinese are investing in include central african republic plantations nigeria oil these groups are called north africans and sub saharan africans respectively afro asiatic speaking peoples predominate in north africa while sub saharan africa is dominated by a number of populations grouped according to their language niger congo predominantly in west africa nilo saharan in the eastern highlands and khoisan in
the south speakers of bantu languages part of the niger congo family are the majority in southern central
and east africa proper but there are also several nilotic groups in east africa and a few remaining indigenous khoisan san or bushmen and pygmy peoples in southern and central africa respectively bantu speaking africans also predominate in gabon and equatorial guinea and are found in parts of southern cameroon and southern somalia in the kalahari desert of southern africa the distinct people known as the bushmen also san closely related to but
distinct from hottentots have long been present the san are physically distinct from other africans and are the indigenous people of southern africa pygmies are the pre bantu indigenous peoples of central africa the peoples of north africa comprise two main groups berber and arabic speaking peoples in the
west and egyptians in the east the arabs who arrived in the seven th century introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa the semitic phoenicians and
the european greeks and romans settled in north africa as well berbers still make up the majority in morocco while they are a significant minority
within algeria they are also present in tunisia and libya the tuareg and other often nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa nubians are a nilo saharan speaking group though many also speak arabic who developed an ancient civilization in northeast africa during the past century or so small but economically important colonies of lebanese and chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa respectively some ethiopian and eritrean groups like the
amhara and tigrayans collectively known as habesha have semitic sabaean ancestry the somalis as a people originated in the ethiopian highlands but most somali clans can trace some arab ancestry as well sudan and mauritania are divided between a mostly arabized north and a native african south although the arabs of sudan clearly have a predominantly native african ancestry themselves some areas of east africa particularly the island of zanzibar and the kenyan island of lamu received arab muslim and southwest asian settlers and merchants throughout the middle ages and in antiquity beginning in the one
six th century europeans such as the portuguese and dutch began to establish trading posts and forts along the coasts of western and southern africa eventually a large number of dutch augmented by french huguenots and germans settled in what is today south africa their descendants the afrikaners and
the coloureds are the largest european descended groups in africa today in the one nine th
century a second phase of colonization brought a large number of french and british settlers to africa the portuguese settled mainly in angola but also in mozambique the french settled in large numbers in algeria where they became known collectively as pieds noirs and on a smaller scale in other areas of north and west africa as well as in madagascar the british settled chiefly in south africa as well as the colony of rhodesia and in the highlands of what is now kenya germans settled in what is now tanzania and namibia and there is still a population of
german speaking white namibians smaller numbers of european soldiers businessmen and officials also established themselves in administrative centers such as nairobi and dakar decolonization during the one nine six zero s often resulted in the mass emigration of european descended settlers out of africa especially
from algeria angola kenya and rhodesia now zimbabwe however in south africa and namibia the white minority remained politically dominant after independence from europe and a significant population of white africans remained in these two countries even after democracy was finally instituted at the end of the cold war south africa has also become the preferred destination of white anglo zimbabweans and of migrants from all over southern africa european colonization also brought sizeable groups of asians particularly people from the indian subcontinent to british colonies large indian communities
are found in south africa and smaller ones are present in kenya tanzania and some other southern and east african countries a fairly large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in one nine seven two though many have since returned the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin often mixed with
africans and europeans the malagasy people of madagascar are a malay people but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu arab indian and european origins malay and indian ancestries are also important components

people nilo saharan languages are mainly spoken in chad sudan ethiopia uganda kenya and northern tanzania the niger congo language family covers much of sub saharan africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages a substantial number of them are the bantu languages spoken in much of sub saharan africa the khoisan languages number about five zero and are spoken in southern africa by approximately one two zero zero zero zero people many of the khoisan languages are endangered the khoi and san peoples are considered the original inhabitants of
this part of africa with a few notable exceptions in east africa nearly all african countries have adopted official languages that originated outside the continent and spread through colonialism or human migration for example in numerous countries english and french are used for communication in the public sphere such as government commerce education and the media arabic portuguese afrikaans and
malagasy are other examples of originally non african languages that are used by millions of africans today both in the
public and private spheres culture africa has a number of overlapping cultures the most conventional distinction is that between sub saharan africa and the northern countries from egypt to morocco
who largely associate themselves with arabic culture in this comparison the nations to the south of the sahara are considered to consist of many cultural areas in particular that of the bantu linguistic group divisions may also be made between francophone africa and the rest of africa in particular the former british colonies of southern and east africa another cultural fault line is that between those africans living traditional lifestyles and those who are
essentially modern the traditionalists are sometimes subdivided into pastoralists and agriculturalists african art reflects the diversity of african cultures the oldest existing art from africa are six zero zero zero year old carvings found in niger while the
great pyramid of giza in egypt was the world s tallest architectural accomplishment for four thousand years until the creation of the eiffel tower the ethiopian complex of monolithic
churches at lalibela of which the church of st george is representative is regarded as another marvel of engineering the music of africa is one of its most dynamic art forms egypt has long been a cultural focus of the arab world while remembrance of the rhythms of sub saharan africa in particular west africa was transmitted through the atlantic slave trade to modern blues jazz reggae rap and rock and roll modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern africa and the dance rhythms of soukous dominated by the

writers african cinema afrology religion africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs with christianity and islam being the most widespread approximately four zero of all africans are christians and another four zero muslims roughly two zero of africans primarily follow indigenous african religions a small number of africans also have beliefs from the judaic tradition such as the beta israel and lemba tribes the indigenous african religions tend to revolve around animism and ancestor worship a common thread in traditional belief systems was the division of
the spiritual world into helpful and harmful helpful spirits are usually deemed to include ancestor spirits that help their descendants and powerful spirits that protected entire communities from natural disaster or attacks from enemies whereas harmful spirits include the souls of murdered victims who were buried without the proper funeral rites and spirits used by hostile spirit mediums to cause illness among their enemies while the effect of these early forms of worship continues to have a profound influence belief systems have evolved as they interact with other religions
the formation of the old kingdom of egypt in the third millennium bce marked the first known complex religious system on the continent around the ninth century bce carthage in present day tunisia was founded by the phoenicians and went on to become a major cosmopolitan center where deities from neighboring egypt rome and the etruscan city states were worshipped the ethiopian orthodox church officially dates from the fourth century and is thus one of the first established christian churches anywhere at first christian orthodoxy made gains in modern day sudan and
other neighbouring regions however following the spread of islam growth was slow and
restricted to the highlands islam entered africa as muslims conquered north africa between six four zero and seven one zero beginning with egypt they established mogadishu melinde mombasa kilwa and sofala following the sea trade down the coast of east africa and diffusing through the sahara desert into the interior of africa following in particular the paths of muslim traders muslims were also among the asian peoples who later settled in
british ruled africa many africans were converted to west european forms of christianity during the colonial period in the last decades of the twentieth century various sects of charismatic christianity rapidly grew a number of roman catholic african bishops were even mentioned as
possible papal candidates in two zero zero five african christians appear to be more socially conservative than their co religionists in much of the industrialized world which has quite recently led to tensions within denominations such

this animation moves at one zero frames per second image animexample two gif this animation moves at two frames per second at this rate the individual frames should be discernible image animhorse gif one two frames per second is the typical rate for an animated cartoon animation is the illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of images of static elements in film and video production this refers to techniques by which each frame of a film or movie is produced individually these frames may be generated by computers or by photographing a drawn
or painted image or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit see claymation and stop motion and then photographing the result with a special animation camera when the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed there is an illusion of continuous movement
due to the phenomenon known as persistence of vision generating such a film tends to be very labour intensive and tedious though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process graphics file formats like gif mng svg and flash swf
allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the internet the animations shown before consist of these six frames toc animation techniques traditional animation
began with each frame being painted and then filmed cel animation developed by bray and hurd in the one nine one zero s sped up the process by using transparent overlays so that characters could be moved without the need to repaint the background for every frame more recently styles of animation based on painting and drawing have evolved such as the minimalist simpsons cartoons or the roughly sketched the snowman computer animation has advanced rapidly and is now approaching
the point where movies can be created with characters so lifelike as to be hard to distinguish from real actors this involved a move from two d to three d the difference being that in two d animation the effect of perspective is created artistically but
in three d objects are modeled in an internal three d representation within the computer and are then lit and shot from chosen angles just as in real life before being rendered to a
two d bitmapped frame predictions that famous dead actors might even be brought back to life to play in new movies before long have led to speculation about the moral and copyright issues involved the use of computer animation as a way of achieving the otherwise impossible in conventionally shot movies has led to the term computer generated imagery being used though the term has become hard to distinguish from computer animation as it is now used in referring to three d movies that are entirely animated computer animation involves modelling motion generation followed by
the addition of surfaces and then rendering surfaces are programmed to stretch and bend automatically in response to movements of a wire frame model and the final rendering converts such movements to a bitmap image it is the recent developments in rendering complex surfaces like fur and clothing textures that have enabled stunningly life like character models including surfaces that even ripple fold and blow in the wind with every
fibre or hair individually calculated for rendering however that actually has little to do with the animation itself animation is the process of bringing a lifeless puppet to life through the use of motion many people confuse fancy effects and high res textures with animation but in fact life like motion can be created using the simplest of models pixar
s work is a testament to this the goal of an animator is not simply to copy the real world but to enhance and to take the essence of the motion that is there and this is how animation can be elevated to the level of art there
is a large misconception in the public mind that computers create animation today this couldn t be further from the truth a computer is nothing more though also nothing less than a very expensive fancy pencil and has to be treated as such for any quality work to be acheived the choices a computer makes when interpolating motion are almost always the wrong ones because the computer does not know what you are trying to create even if a
complex physics system were created complete enough to exactly mimic the real world the end result would not be the desirable one because a large part of animation concerns the choices an animator makes when a computer tries to make the choices for you disaster is the general result history the major use of animation has always been for entertainment however there is growing use of instructional animation and educational animation to support explanation and learning the classic form
of animation the animated cartoon as developed in the early one nine zero zero s and refined by ub iwerks walt disney and others requires up to two four distinct drawings for one second of animation this technique is described in detail in the article traditional animation because animation is very time consuming and often very expensive to produce the majority of animation for tv and movies comes from professional animation studios however the field of independent animation has
existed at least since the one nine five zero s with animation being produced by independent studios and sometimes by a single person several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional
animation industry bill plympton is one of the most well known independent animators today limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using short cuts in the animation process this method was pioneered by upa and popularized some say exploited by hanna barbera and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television animation studios animation studios like movie studios may be production facilities or financial entities in some cases especially in anime they
have things in common with artists studios where a master or group of talented individuals oversee the work

british museum in greek and roman mythology apollo greek ap ll n or apell n was a god of light healing and poetry apollo was the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt as the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle apollo was
one of the most important and many sided of the olympian deities in etruscan mythology he was known as aplu in later times apollo became partly confused or equated with helios god of the sun and his sister similarly equated with selene
god of the moon particularly in religious contexts however apollo
and helios remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts domains and symbols apollo
the son of zeus and the mortal leto apollo was considered to have dominion over disease beauty light healing colonists medicine archery poetry
prophecy dance reason intellectualism and shamans and was the patron defender
of herds and flocks apollo s most common attributes were the lyre and the bow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre and plectrum another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo s honor every four years at delphi the laurel bay plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals
sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins and roe swans and grasshoppers symbolizing music and song hawks ravens crows and snakes referencing apollo s function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin as god of colonization apollo gave guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization seven five zero five five zero bc according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists find the city of troy however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention a
minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa which is now regarded as being identical with the greek illios by most scholars in this interpretation apollo s title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god s supposed link with wolves possibly
a folk etymology apollo popularly e g in literary criticism represents harmony order and reasons characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who popularly represents emotion and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphi oracle to
dionysus worship apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae apollo is known as the leader of the muses musagetes and director of their choir hymns sung to apollo were called paeans the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks there is a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings during the reign of tarquinius superbus in four three zero a temple was dedicated to apollo on the occasion of
a pestilence during the second punic war in two one two the ludi
apollinares were instituted in his honor in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium augustus enlarged his old temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected a new temple on the palatine hill and transferred the secular games for which horace composed his carmen saeculare to apollo and diana the chief festivals held in honour of apollo
were the carneia daphnephoria delia hyacinthia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia the ludi apollinares were solemn games held to honor him the worship of apollo has returned with the rise of revivalist hellenic polytheism and the contemporary pagan movement one example of this revival is the group kyklos apollon also together with athena apollo under the name phevos was controversially designated as a mascot of the two zero zero four summer olympics in athens etymology the name apollo might have been derived from a pre hellenic compound apo ollon likely related to an archaic verb apo ell and
literally meaning he who elbows off that is the dispelling one indeed he seems to have personified dispelling power which would relate to his association with the darkness dispelling power of the morning sun and the conceived power of reason and prophecy to dispel doubt and ignorance in addition the apparent
expelling character of city walls and doorways as bulwarks against trespassers the people dispelling nature of disembarkations and expatriations to colonies the disease dispelling character of healing the predator dispelling character of a shepherd
tending his flocks the pest dispelling nature of a farmer growing crops the power of music and the arts to dispel discord and barbary the highly important power of fit and skilled young men to dispel intruders and invading armies the ability of foresight into the future an explanation given by plutarch in moralia is that apollon signified a unity since pollon meant many and the prefix a was a negative thus apollon could be read as meaning deprived of multitude apollo was
consequently associated with the monad hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric which means assembly so that apollo would be the
god of political life and he also gives the explanation fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds apollo with a radiant halo in a roman floor mosaic el djem tunisia lare two nd century apollo in art in art apollo is usually depicted as a handsome beardless young man and often with a lyre or bow in hand in the late two nd century floor mosaic from el djem roman
thysdrus illustration right he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a god s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire anther haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling
hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the three rd century bce to depict alexander the great bieber one nine six four yalouris one nine eight
zero some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ will be beardless and haloed appellations epithets applied to apollo include phoebus shining one for apollo in the context of the god of light smintheus mouse catcher and parnopius grasshopper as god of the plague and defender against rats and
locusts delphinios delphinian meaning of the womb associating apollo with delphoi delphi an aitiology in the homeric hymns connects the epitheton to dolphins archegetes director of the foundation for colonies musagetes leader of the muses pythios pythian at delphi

that leto was pregnant and that hera s husband zeus was the father she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma or the mainland or any island at sea in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor a real island and gave birth there the island was surrounded by swans afterwards zeus secured delos to
the bottom of the ocean this island later became sacred to apollo alternatively hera kidnapped ilithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace nine yards long of amber either way artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of apollo another version states that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of
ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo apollo was born on the seven th day of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seven th and two zero th the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him youth in his youth apollo killed the vicious dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring according to some because python had attempted to rape leto while she was pregnant with apollo
and artemis this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophesies apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was a child of gaia apollo
and admetus when zeus struck down apollo s son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead and thus stealing hades s subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclops who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labour as punishment thanks to
the intercession of his mother leto during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly admetus
treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughtor of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place but when it came time for admetus to die his elderly parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living apollo during the trojan war apollo
shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in rage because the greeks had kidnapped chryseis the daughter of apollo s priest he demanded her return and the greeks eventually complied when diomedes injured aeneas during the
trojan war apollo rescued him first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos a sacred spot in troy artemis healed aeneas there apollo had aided paris in the killing of achilles if paris did not accomplish the task himself niobe a queen of thebes and wife of amphion niobe boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male
and seven female while leto had only two apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics with the last begging for his life and artemis her daughters apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth a number of the niobids were spared chloris usually amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge a devastated niobe fled to mt siplyon in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her
tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them apollo s romantic life and children female lovers apollo chased the nymph daphne daughter of peneus who had scorned him his infatuation was caused by an arrow from eros who was jealous because
apollo had made fun of his archery skills eros also claimed to be irritated by apollo s singing simultaneously however eros had shot a hate arrow into daphne causing her to be repulsed by apollo following a spirited
chase by apollo daphne prayed to mother earth alternatively her father a river god to help her and he changed her into a laurel tree which became sacred to apollo apollo had an affair with a mortal princess named leucothea daughter of orchamus and sister of clytia leucothea loved apollo who disguised himself as leucothea s mother to gain entrance to her chambers clytia jealous of her sister because she wanted apollo for herself told orchamus the truth betraying her
sister s trust and confidence in her enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well
zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo
being immortal would tire of her when she grew old castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dived into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named
after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire poets by cyrene apollo had a son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and bee keeping he was also a culture hero and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting as well as how to cultivate olives with hecuba wife of king priam of troy apollo had a son named troilius an oracle prophesied that troy would not be
defeated as long as troilius reached the age of twenty alive he and his sister polyxena were ambushed and killed by achilles apollo also fell in love with cassandra daughter of hecuba and priam and troilius half sister he promised cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards enraged apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future with a
curse that no one would ever believe her coronis daughter of phlegyas king of
the lapiths was another of apollo s liaisons pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus a crow informed apollo of the affair when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as a punishment for speading untruths when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis as a result
he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur
chiron to raise phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi apollo then killed him for what he did male lovers apollo and hyacinthus jacopo caraglio one six th c italian engraving apollo the eternal beardless kouros himself had the most male lovers of all the greek gods that was to be expected from
a god who was god of the palaestra the athletic gathering place for youth who all competed in the nude a god said to represent the ideal educator and therefore the ideal
erastes or lover of a boy sergent p one zero two all his lovers were younger than him in the style of the greek pederastic relationships of the time many of apollo s young beloveds died accidentally a reflection on the function of these myths as part of rites of passage in which the youth died in order to be reborn as an adult hyacinth was one of his male lovers hyacinthus was a spartan prince beautiful and athletic the pair were practicing throwing the discus when hyacinthus was struck
in the head by a discus blown off course by zephyrus who was jealous of apollo and loved hyacinthus as well when hyacinthus died apollo is said in some accounts to have been so filled with grief that he cursed his own immortality wishing to join
his lover in mortal death out of the blood of his slain lover apollo created the hyacinth flower as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with meaning
alas the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta one of his other liaisons was with acantha the spirit of the acanthus tree upon his death he was transformed into a sun loving herb by apollo and his bereaved sister acanthis was turned into a thistle finch by the other gods another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles apollo gave the boy a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus asked
apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo turned the sad boy into a cypress tree which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk apollo and the birth of hermes hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by
zeus in a secret affair maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos
covering their tracks in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced
himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo s claim zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo hermes then began to play
music on the lyre he had invented apollo a god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange the cattle for the lyre hence apollo became a master of the lyre and hermes invented a kind of pipes instrument called a syrinx later apollo exchanged a caduceus for a syrinx from hermes other stories musical contests pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo
the god of the lyre to a trial of skill tmolus the mountain god was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such a
depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey marsyas the flaying of marsyas by titian c one five seven zero seven six marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music he had found an aulos on the ground tossed
away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy marsyas lost and was flayed alive in a cave near calaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god his blood turned into the river marsyas another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive taken from man myth who mourns for adonis a man claiming to be apollo is seen on a greek themed planet that captain kirk pavel chekov mr

seven agassi turned professional in one nine eight six and won his first top level singles title in one nine eight seven at itaparica he won six further tournaments in one nine eight eight and by december that year he had surpassed us two million in career prize money after playing in just four three tournaments the quickest player in history to do so as a young up and coming player agassi embraced a rebel
image he grew his hair to rock star length sported an ear ring
and wore colorful shirts that pushed tennis still strict sartorial boundaries he boasted of a cheeseburger heavy diet and endorsed the canon rebel camera image is everything was the ad s tag line and it became andre s as well strong performances on the tour meant that agassi
was quickly tipped as a future grand slam champion but he began the one nine nine zero s with a series of near misses he reached his first grand slam final in one nine nine zero at the french open where he lost in four sets to the seasoned veteran player andr s g mez later that year he lost in the final of the us open to another up and coming teenaged star pete sampras the rivalry between these two american players was to become the dominant rivalry in
tennis over the rest the of the decade in one nine nine one agassi reached his second consecutive french open final where he faced his former bollettieri academy mate jim courier courier emerged the victor in a dramatic rain interrupted five set final agassi chose not to play at wimbledon from one nine eight eight nine zero and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event s traditionalism particularly its predominantly white dress code which players at the event are required to conform
to many observers at the time speculated that agassi s real motivation was that his strong baseline game would not be
well suited to wimbledon s grass court surface agassi decided to play at wimbledon
in one nine nine one leading to weeks of speculation in the media about what he would wear he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit he reached the quarter finals on that occasion to the surprise of many agassi s grand slam breakthrough came at
wimbledon in one nine nine two when he beat goran ivani evi in a tight five set final following wrist surgery in one nine nine three agassi came back strongly in one nine nine four and captured the us open beating michael stich in the final he then captured his first australian open title in one nine nine five beating sampras in a four set final he won a career high seven titles that year and he reached the world no one ranking for the first time that april he held it for three zero weeks on
that occasion through to november he compiled a career best two six match winning streak during the summer hardcourt circuit which ended when he lost in the us open final to sampras in one nine nine five agassi won seven singles titles the biggest being the australian open the cincinnati masters the miami masters and the canada masters in terms of win
loss record one nine nine five was agassi s best year seven two one zero includes davis cup this is
slightly short of sampras s best season one nine nine four in which he sampras won seven seven matches and lost one two in one nine nine six agassi won the men s singles gold medal at the olympic games in atlanta beating sergi bruguera of spain in straight sets in the final he also repeated at the cincinnati masters and the miami masters one nine nine seven was a poor year for agassi he won no top level titles and his ranking sank to world no one four one in november his
form was perhaps affected by the intense publicity surrounding his high profile and turbulent relationship and marriage to actress brooke shields one nine nine eight two zero zero four in one nine nine eight agassi rededicated himself to tennis he shaved his balding head began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in challenger series tournaments a circuit for
professional players ranked outside the world s top five zero perhaps most remarkably the one time rebel emerged as a gracious and thoughtful athlete looked up to by younger players after winning matches he took to bowing and blowing a two handed kisses to spectators on each side of the court a gesture seen as a rather humble acknowledgment of their support for him and for tennis in one nine nine eight agassi
won five titles and leapt from no one two two on the rankings at the start of the year to no six at the end of it making it the highest jump into the top one zero made by any player in tennis he won five titles in ten finals and finished runner up at the miami masters agassi entered the history books in one nine nine nine when he beat andrei medvedev in a five set french open final to become only the fifth male player to have won all four grand
slam singles titles a feat last achieved in the one nine six zero s by roy emerson he followed this up by reaching the wimbledon final where he lost to sampras he then won the us open beating todd martin in five sets in the final and finished the year ranked the world no one agassi began two zero zero zero by capturing his second australian open title beating yevgeny kafelnikov in a four set final he was the first male player to have reached four consecutive grand slam finals since rod laver achieved the grand slam in
one nine six nine two zero zero zero also saw agassi reach the semi finals at wimbledon where he lost in five sets to patrick rafter in a very high quality battle considered by many to be one of the best matches ever played at wimbledon at the inaugural tennis masters
cup in lisbon agassi made it all the way to the final after defeating marat safin six three six three in the semifinals to end the russian s hopes to become the youngest world no one in the history of tennis agassi eventually lost to gustavo kuerten six four six four six four this loss allowed kuerten to be crowned year end world no one two zero zero zero is considered by many of his fans
to be a disappointing season for agassi as he managed to win only one tournament two zero zero zero australian open agassi opened two zero zero one by successfully defending his australian open title with a straight sets final win over arnaud clement at wimbledon he battled rafter again in the semi finals and lost eight six in the fifth set at the us open he lost in the quarter finals to sampras in what is
considered to be one of tournament s all time greatest matches sampras won six seven seven six seven six seven six in a match with no breaks of serve agassi and sampras last duel came in the final of the us open in
two zero zero two the battle between the two veterans saw sampras emerge victorious in four sets and left sampras with a two zero one four edge in their three four career meetings the match in fact proved to be the last of sampras career he did not play in an event on the professional tour again and officially announced his retirement in two zero

title in one nine seven zero at age three five agassi has also won one doubles title at the cincinnati masters in one nine nine three partnering petr korda he is one of
only five male players to have won all the grand slams along with legends don budge roy emerson rod laver and fred perry he is in fact the first male tennis player to win the four grand slams on four different surfaces the previous players won the australian open wimbledon and the us open on grass courts and the
french open on clay courts whereas agassi won the australian open on rebound ace the french open on clay wimbledon on grass and the us open on hardcourts after winning french open in one nine nine nine agassi became the first male tennis player to win the career golden slam agassi also helped the united states win the davis cup in one nine nine zero and one nine nine two he was named the bbc overseas sports personality of the year in one nine

year through endorsements the most by any tennis player and fourth in all sports first place is tiger woods at us seven zero million a
year two zero zero five agassi started off two zero zero five with strong runs most of which were cut short by roger federer
he lost to federer in the quarterfinals of the australian open and the semifinals at dubai he reached the quarterfinals at indian wells after a dominant victory over guillermo coria but withdrew from his match with lleyton hewitt with a swollen big toe agassi lost in the semifinals at miami to federer in a tight match although the claycourt season is the toughest on the body agassi played in rome
and reached the semifinals which he lost to coria in a tough battle at the two zero zero five french open agassi lost to jarkko nieminem in their first round match after enduring back pain related to a pinched sciatic nerve he lost in five sets with six zero in the fifth after much media speculation about retirement the three five year old agassi won in los angeles and made the final at montreal before falling to world no two rafael nadal in three long sets that he might have won
if a few points had gone differently his coach darren cahill and close friend and personal trainer gil reyes worked with agassi throughout the summer to prepare for the two zero zero five us open agassi made a spectacular run at the open beating razvan sabau six three six three six one ivo karlovic in the second round seven six seven four seven six seven five seven six seven four tom
berdych three six six one six four seven six seven two and xavier malisse six three six four six seven five seven four six six two his quarterfinal match against fellow american james blake has been called one of the best matches in us open history after dropping the first two sets three
six three six agassi took the next two six three six three in the fifth set blake served for the match at five four but agassi broke his serve then won the tiebreak eight six to secure the victory at one one five a m he defeated robby ginepri another rising talented american with a consistent baseline game in his third consecutive five set match to earn a spot in the final against world no one roger federer after losing the first set six three agassi broke federer
twice to win the second six two he broke federer again and at this point looked to
be the better player agassi had a three zero love lead but with a few costly errors was broken to force a tiebreak which federer took seven one andre ran out of gas which allowed federer to reel off five straight games being down five zero in the fourth
set agassi held to make it five one before federer closed it out to win the championship after the match agassi thanked new york for the two zero years of memories hinting at potential retirement however
agassi has made clear that he will only retire on his terms when he feels that he cannot perform at his best on the court he will likely continue for another year as he has qualified for the two zero zero five masters cup which is limited to the eight best players in the world and is scheduled to play the lead in tournament to the two zero zero six australian open coming into the two zero zero five
masters cup agassi is two nine five on hard courts with his only losses coming to roger federer and rafael nadal and is five four on clay wins over gasquet ljubicic and hrbaty losses
to coria and lopez in two zero zero five agassi left nike after one seven years and signed an endorsement deal with adidas hampered by a third degree ankle injury caused by several torn ligaments agassi lost his opening match against nikolay davydenko in the masters cup and was forced to withdraw the withdrawal list also included rafael nadal andy roddick lleyton hewitt and marat safin two zero zero six agassi withdrew from the australian open because of an ankle injury once he
withdrew he immediately requested a wildcard to enter the delray beach international tennis championships where he eventually finished as a quarterfinalist losing to guillermo garcia lopez four six two six he was then forced to retire from sap open because of a lower back injury causing him severe pain in his lower back and down his legs he then played in the dubai open where he won in straight sets over greg rusedski in the first round before losing in straights to german bjorn phau in second round health permitting agassi is scheduled to play tournaments in indian
wells and miami to close out the winter hardcourt season agassi has officially said that he is skipping the entire clay season since it burdens his body he will do his best to be ready for wimbledon however agassi s top priority in two zero zero six will once
again be making yet another run at the us open
in august expect all scheduling decisons to be made with that goal in mind playing style agassi employs a baseline style of play but unlike most such players he typically makes contact with the ball inside the baseline exceptionally difficult even for professionals this is possible because of his short backswing which also helps him return fast serves he is also blessed with the best hand and eye coordination rivaled only by roger federer john mcenroe and others have called agassi the best service returner ever to play professional tennis after agassi s rededication to tennis in one
nine nine eight he has focused more on physical conditioning than in the past and is now one of the fittest players on
the tour his upper body strength allows him to bench press three five zero lbs he has remarkable endurance and rarely appears tired on court as long as he is not injured he handles long grueling matches arguably better than any other player on the tour even roger federer has been known to tire by the fifth set indeed agassi is often ready to start the next point when his opponent is catching his breath one of his
strategies is to wear down his opponents continually putting pressure on them by returning the ball early and deep at angles agassi will try to stand in nearly one spot and hit the corners to make his opponent scramble he will often pass up the winner and hit a slightly less aggressive shot to make his opponent run a little more to retrieve a few more shots his penchant for running players around point after point has earned him the nickname the
punisher agassi s biggest weakness currently is his lack of consistent
speed and players who are able to consistently hit at sharp angles with pace give him trouble agassi used to be one of the fastest players on tour however his recent injuries have forced him to
consistently run his fastest selectively usually in grand slams and tennis masters series events to make up for this recently adopted weakness agassi generally keeps his
opponent on the defense federer is the only player with a long winning streak against agassi even sampras lost to agassi many times personal and family life after a four year courtship agassi married actress brooke shields in a lavish ceremony on
april one nine one nine nine seven that february they had filed suit against the national enquirer claiming it printed false and fabricated statements brooke was undergoing counseling binge eating and taking pills agassi lashed into brooke and he and brooke s mother tangled like wildcats when she demanded a prenup the case was dismissed agassi filed for divorce which was granted on april nine one nine nine nine by the time the divorce was final agassi was dating the german tennis legend steffi graf with only their mothers as witnesses they were married at
his home on october two two two zero zero one their son jaden gil was born six weeks prematurely on october two six that year their daughter jaz elle was born on october three two zero zero three agassi s older sister rita married the former tennis legend pancho gonzales in one nine nine five when gonzales died in las vegas andre paid for his brother in law s funeral andre has participated in many charity organizations and founded the andre agassi charitable association which assists the youth
of las vegas in one nine nine five he has won one nine nine five s atp arthur ashe s humanitarian award in recognition of his efforts helping disadvantaged youth in la the andre agassi charitable foundation has always and will continue to fund organizations which offer programs that consistently carry out the mission of the foundation the foundation s mission is to provide educational and recreational institutions and activities for abandoned abused and at risk
kids the following organizations are fine examples the andre agassi boys claim agassi by both the armenian and iranian communities in the united states and abroad agassi has often seemed somewhat ambivalent for example joking after his all armenian match against sargis sargsian at the us open in two zero zero four well i m only
half armenian though he agreed to appear in a pbs documentary about armenian americans his father has written in his book the agassi story about
his experience of being an outsider in muslim iran but andre has also shown interest in the iranian aspect of his heritage in february two zero zero five expressing a desire to visit iran which holds a special
place in his heart quotes about pete sampras retirement you grow up with a guy you compete against him for so long he s such a big part of your career something that s pretty special so you do have that sense of personal regret that he s not around any more you miss having that around during the two zero zero five us open i ve been
motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me there still is plenty out there to get motivated by from mats wilander asked to name the top five tennis players of all time he placed agassi sampras federer and borg in the top four in no order and tied mcenroe lendl and connors for fifth place on agassi he has some limitations like he can t serve and volley yet he has won all four slams he has a very high energy level quite like borg he is on fifth
gear from the very first point there is some abnormality in his eyes otherwise he wouldn t have had such a phenomenal return he sees the ball like none else and just guides it wherever he wants to he s just played a grand slam final at three five that tells me he wasted the first five years of his career
otherwise he couldn t have lasted this long no one has done more to tennis than agassi and borg video games andre agassi tennis for the snes sega genesis game gear and mobile phone

open champions list of assyrians austro asiatic languages the austro asiatic languages are a large language family of southeast asia and india the name comes from the
greek words for south asia among these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have a long recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status in vietnam and cambodia respectively the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across india and southeast asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken it is widely believed that the austroasiatic languages are the autochthonous languages of southeast asia and eastern india and that the other languages of the region including the indo
european tai kadai and sino tibetan languages are the result of later migrations of people there are for example austroasiatic words in the tibeto burman languages of eastern nepal some linguists have attempted to prove that
austroasiatic languages are related to austronesian languages thus forming the austric
superfamily linguists traditionally recognize two major divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia and the munda languages of east central and central india ethnologue identifies one six eight austroasiatic languages of which one four seven are mon khmer languages and two one are munda languages however no evidence for this classification has ever
been published and it remains speculative each of the subdivisions of the classification below that is written in boldface type is accepted as a valid family however the relationships between these families within austroasiatic is debated it should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review the classification used here is that of diffloth in press which does not accept traditional mon khmer as

controversial partly for lack of data harold fleming tentatively suggests that it is an independent branch of non omotic afro asiatic it is not generally agreed on where
proto afro asiatic was spoken africa e g igor diakonoff lionel bender has often been suggested particularly ethiopia
because it includes the majority of the diversity of the afro asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in
close geographic proximity often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin the western red sea coast and the sahara have also been put forward e g christopher ehret alexander militarev suggests that their homeland was in the levant specifically he identifies them with the natufian culture the semitic languages are the
only afro asiatic subfamily based outside of africa however in historical or near historical times some semitic speakers crossed from south arabia back into ethiopia so some
modern ethiopian languages such as amharic are semitic rather than belonging to the substrate cushitic or omotic groups a minority of academics e g a murtonen one nine six seven dispute this view suggesting that semitic may have originated in ethiopia tonal languages are found in the omotic chadic and south build ehret b n attested in chadic semitic bny cushitic m

classification history medieval scholars sometimes linked two or more branches of afro asiatic together already in the nine th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret

suggestion was largely ignored marcel cohen one nine two four rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa a chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary joseph greenberg one nine five zero strongly confirmed cohen s rejection of hamitic added and sub classified the chadic languages and proposed the new name afro asiatic for the family his classification of it came to be almost universally accepted in one nine six nine harold fleming proposed the recognition of omotic as a fifth branch rather than
as previously believed a subgroup of cushitic and this has become generally accepted several scholars including harold fleming and
robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic but this view has yet to gain general acceptance there is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned however christopher ehret one nine seven nine harold fleming one nine eight one and joseph greenberg one nine eight

split from the rest otherwise ehret groups egyptian berber and semitic together in a north afro asiatic subgroup paul newman one nine eight zero groups berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic while questioning the inclusion of omotic fleming one nine eight one divided non omotic afroasiatic or erythraean into three groups cushitic semitic and chadic berber egyptian he

name the name andorra probably originates from a navarrese word andurrial which translates as shrub covered land history tradition holds that charlemagne granted a charter to the andorran people in
return for their fighting the moors overlordship of the territory passed to the local count of urgell and eventually to the bishop of the diocese of urgell in the one one th century a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern french neighbour over andorra in one two seven eight the conflict was resolved by the signing of a parage which provided that
andorra s sovereignty be shared between the french count of foix whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state and the bishop of la seu d urgell in catalonia this
gave the small principality its territory and political form over the years the title
passed to the kings of navarre after henry of navarre became king henry iv of france he issued an edict one six zero seven that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co princes of andorra in the period one eight one two one three the french empire annexed catalonia and divided it in four departments andorra

from spain from one nine three six to one nine four zero a french detachment was garrisoned in andorra to prevent influences of the spanish civil war and franco s spain the franco troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war during the second world war andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy
france and spain in one nine five eight andorra declared peace with germany having been forgotten on the treaty of versailles that ended the first world war and remaining legally at war given its relative isolation andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history with few ties to countries other than france and spain in recent times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transportation and
communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in one nine nine three the year in which it finally became a member of the united nations politics until very recently andorra s political system had no clear division of powers into executive legislative and judicial branches ratified and approved in one nine nine three the constitution establishes
andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co princes as heads of state but the head of government retains executive power the two co princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts they are represented in andorra by a delegate the way in which the two princes are chosen makes andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth one

economies of adjoining france and spain have been opened up providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs the banking sector with its tax haven status also contributes substantially to the economy agricultural production is limited only two of the land is arable and most food has to
be imported the principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes cigars and furniture andorra is not a full member of the european union but enjoys a special relationship with it such as
being treated as an eu member for trade in manufactured goods no tariffs and as a non eu member for agricultural products andorra lacks a currency of its own and uses
that of its two surrounding nations prior to one nine nine nine these were the french franc and the spanish peseta which have since been replaced by a single currency the euro unlike other small
european states that use the euro andorra does not yet mint its own euro coins in october two zero zero four negotiations between andorra and the eu began on an agreement which would allow andorra to mint its own coins andorra s natural resources include hydropower mineral water timber iron ore and lead demographics andorrans constitute a minority in their own country only

of all the members of the set divided by the number of items in the set cardinality the word set is used perhaps somewhat loosely for example the number three eight could occur more than once in such a set if one particular number occurs more times than others in the set it is called a mode the arithmetic mean is what pupils are taught very early
to call the average if the set is a statistical population then we speak of the population mean if the set is a statistical sample we call the resulting statistic a sample mean when the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median the set of numbers or frequency distribution is said to be skewed the symbol greek mu is used to denote the arithmetic mean of a population if we denote a
set of data by x then the sample mean is
typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable x generally enunciated x bar in practice the difference between and x is that is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population and if the sample is drawn randomly then one
may treat x but not as a random variable attributing a probability distribution to it both are computed in the same way mathrm bar x one cdots x n n the arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by outliers for instance reporting the average net worth in redmond washington as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of bill gates these distortions occur when the mean is different from the median and the median is a superior alternative when that happens in certain situations the arithmetic mean is the
wrong concept of average altogether for example if a stock rose one zero in the first year three zero in the second year and fell one zero in the third year then it would be incorrect to report its average increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean one zero three zero one zero three one zero
the correct average in this case is the geometric mean which yields an average
increase per year of only eight eight if x is a random variable then the expected value of x can be seen as the long term arithmetic mean
that occurs on repeated measurements of x this is the content of the law of large numbers as a result the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values note that several other means have been defined including the generalized mean the generalized f mean the harmonic mean the arithmetic geometric mean and the weighted mean alternate notations the arithmetic mean may
also be expressed using the sum notation bar frac one n sum n x i see also mean average summary statistics variance central tendency standard deviation inequality of arithmetic and geometric means muirhead

year terms he was defeated in the electoral college vote by the republican candidate george w bush on a vote of two seven one two six six with a gore committed elector from washington dc abstaining however gore did receive more individual votes than bush the election was bitterly contested including multiple recounts and a five four supreme court decision that effectively
secured the election for president george w bush gore currently serves as president of the american television channel current and chairman of generation investment management sits on the board of directors of apple computer and serves as
an unofficial advisor to google s senior management although speculation about a possible presidential run in two zero zero eight still continues he has stated that he does not currently plan to return to politics but doesn t rule this possibility out in the future early life he attended the sheridan school and later the elite st albans school in one nine six five gore enrolled at

for four months although opposed to the vietnam war on august seven one nine six nine gore enlisted in the army to participate in the vietnam war effort after completing training as a military journalist gore shipped to vietnam in early one nine seven one serving for four months before being given an honorable discharge the chronology of gore s military service is as follows
august one nine six nine enlisted at the newark new jersey recruiting office august to october one nine six nine eight weeks of basic training at fort dix new jersey late october one nine six nine to december one nine seven zero fort rucker alabama on the job occupational training at the army flier newspaper january one nine seven one to may one nine seven one field reporter in vietnam part of the two zero th engineer brigade stationed primarily at bien hoa air base near saigon may two four one nine seven one
given an honorable discharge after his early discharge request was granted gore stated many times that he opposed the vietnam war but chose to enlist anyway some observers have noted that gore could have avoided vietnam in a number of ways gore considered all these options but said that his sense of civic duty compelled him to serve alexander cockburn and jeffrey st clair suggest in al gore a user s manual that gore joined the military for political gain because gore served as a journalist he was never exposed to front line combat although some
allege that his famous father s influence helped him to obtain this position most military analysts agree that any man who enlisted with a harvard degree had a good chance of being assigned a support specialty rather than an infantry position even at the war s height eight eight of all servicemen
were assigned to noncombatant specialties however gore s decision to enlist for a two year term did mean that he would not be able to select his assignment a choice which was available to three year enlistees according to newsweek journalist bill turque s biography inventing al gore which does not shy away from criticism and scandals such as charging gore with smoking marijuana far more frequently than he admits dess stokes staff sergeant at the newark armed forces entrance and examination station on the
day he walked in doesn t remember any communication from superiors about gore
a kid with gore s background a one three four iq and a
harvard degree he said didn t need to be a senator s son with high level contacts to get the military job he wanted gore s father al gore sr lost the one nine seven zero election and was no longer a senator by the time gore arrived in vietnam but was a senator until january one nine seven one which included the time his son would have received his assignment some critics charge that his father s stature led gore s superiors to give him less
dangerous assignments than they might otherwise have given him according to combat photographer h alan leo gore was protected from dangerous situations at the request
of brigadier general kenneth b cooper the two zero th engineer brigades commander leo stated that gore s trips into the field were safe and that gore could have worn a tuxedo these remarks seem to contradict gore s many public statements i carried an m one six i pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass and
i was fired upon baltimore sun i took my turn regularly on the perimeter in these little firebases out in the boonies something would move we
d fire first and ask questions later vanity fair i was
shot at i spent most of my time in the field washington post i used to fly these things combat helicopters with the doors open sitting on the ledge with our feet hanging down if you flew low and fast they wouldn t have as much time to shoot you weekly
standard for his part gore has stated that he knew leo but rarely traveled with him in vietnam and that he never felt that he was being given special protection on the other hand leo s testimony is that cooper gave the orders before gore arrived so gore would not know about them the question of whether leo frequently traveled with gore or not still has not been conclusively answered turque s book however states that cooper said that he has no recollection of even meeting leo
much less discussing gore s safety with him the evidence indicates that if there was an official effort to guarantee gore s safety it was uneven at best his clippings from the castle courier the newspaper of the u s army engineering command and other publications suggest
that he pulled his weight which in his case meant choppering around to report features about the good works of
the two zero th engineers when smith said he was scheduled to leave for r r in hawaii the sergeant called for volunteers gore stepped up and spent a cold night in a foxhole al did what everybody else did said mike o hara the photographer who shot the khe sanh assignment regulations allowed for early release of personnel to teach or attend school if their services were deemed not essential to the mission and gore certainly qualified gore stated in one nine eight eight that his experience in vietnam didn t change my conclusions about the war being a
terrible mistake but it struck me that opponents to the war including myself really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of south vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and
worked in the fields was something i was naively unprepared for after returning from vietnam gore spent five years as a reporter for the tennessean a newspaper headquartered in nashville tennessee during this time gore also attended vanderbilt divinity school and law school although he did not complete a degree at either congress al gore speaks during a congressional hearing in the one nine eight zero s in the
spring of one nine seven six gore quit law school to run for the u

the one nine nine two election al gore was inaugurated as the four five th vice president of the united states on january two zero one nine nine three clinton and gore were re elected to a second term in the one nine nine six election during his time as vice president al gore was mostly a behind the scenes player however many experts consider him to be one of the most
active and influential vice presidents in u s history this was evident as gore had weekly lunches with clinton to keep each other abreast of current developments although he later said that it was he who insisted on having those weekly lunches in the first place debate with perot in one nine nine
three gore debated ross perot on cnn s larry king live on the issue of free trade public opinion polls taken after the debate showed that a majority of americans agreed with his point of view and supported nafta some claim that this performance may have been responsible for the passing of nafta in the house of representatives where it passed two three four two zero
zero initatives one of gore s major accomplishments as vice president was the national performance review which pointed out waste fraud and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations his book later helped guide president clinton when he down sized the federal government internet education as vice president gore instituted a federal program calling for all schools and libraries to be wired to the internet this was a culmination of work that he had started several years before
while serving in the senate gore had introduced legislation which called for the creation of a new federal research center for educational computing to support an information systems highway environment during gore s tenure as vice president he was a strong
proponent for environmental protection while a senator working on his book earth in the balance gore had traveled around the world on numerous fact finding missions on earth day one nine nine four gore launched the worldwide globe program an innovative hands on school based education and science activity that made extensive use of the internet to increase student
awareness of their environment and contribute research data for scientists the opinions he developed on issues such as global warming the depletion of the ozone layer and the destruction of rain forests is said to have played a major role in policy making for the clinton administration in the late nineties gore
strongly pushed for the passage of the kyoto treaty which called for reduction in green house emissions foreign policy because of president clinton s inexperience and gore s service in vietnam and in the senate clinton would often look to gore for advice in the area of foreign policy gore was one of the first to call for action to remove yugoslav president slobodan milo evi from power in one nine nine eight gore also supported operation desert fox a three day bombing campaign against iraq that attempted to degrade saddam hussein s
ability to make and to use weapons of mass destruction vice president al gore works along side president clinton in trying to negotiate a middle east
peace plan with palestinian leader yasser arafat other during the clinton gore administration americans enjoyed eight years of relative peace along with the longest economic expansion in history democrats attributed this prosperity to the policies
of the clinton gore administration and especially to the passage of the omnibus budget reconciliation act
of one nine nine three for which gore cast the tie breaking vote during his two zero zero zero campaign for the presidency gore attributed several positive economic results to his and clinton s policies more than two two million new jobs highest homeownership in american history lowest unemployment in three zero years paid off three six zero billion of the national debt lowest poverty rate in two zero years
higher incomes at all levels converted the largest budget deficit up to that time in american history to the largest surplus lowest government spending in three decades lowest federal income tax burden in three five years and more families own stock than ever before however gore later placed a large share of the blame for his election loss on the economic downturn and nasdaq crash of
march two zero zero zero in an interview with national public radio s bob edwards two zero zero zero presidential election al gore and running mate joe lieberman at the two zero zero zero democratic national convention after two terms as vice president gore ran for president in the democratic primaries gore faced an early challenge from bill bradley gore s nomination was never really in doubt and bradley withdrew from the race in early march two zero zero zero after failing to
win any state primary or caucus in august two zero zero zero gore surprised many when he selected united states senator joe lieberman to be his vice presidential running mate lieberman who is a more conservative democrat than gore had publicly blasted president clinton for the monica lewinsky affair many pundits saw gore s choice of lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandal prone clinton white house lieberman was also the first jewish
nominee on a major party s national ticket during the entire campaign gore was neck and neck in the polls with republican governor of texas george w bush on election day the results were so close that the outcome of the race took over a month to resolve highlighted by the premature declaration of a winner on election night and an extremely close result in the state of florida on election night news networks first called florida for gore then fox news
decided to call it for bush and all of the other news stations followed their
decision the race was ultimately decided by a razor thin margin of only five three seven popular votes in florida a state favored to have gone to bush as his brother served
as governor the five three seven number was an astonishingly close margin out of some one zero five million votes cast nationwide florida s two five electoral votes were awarded to
george w bush only after numerous court challenges al gore publicly conceded the election after the supreme court in bush v gore voted seven to two to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional because it feared that different standards would be used in different parts of
the state and five to four to ban recounts using other procedures al gore makes a point during a presidential debate during the two zero zero zero election as george w bush looks on gore strongly disagreed with the court s decision but decided for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy i offer my concession he had previously made a concession phone call to bush the night of the election but quickly retracted it after learning just how close the election was following the
election a subsequent recount conducted by various u s news media organizations indicated that mr bush would have won using the partial recount method of four strongly democratic areas advocated by mr gore but that mr gore would have won given a full recount of the state
the states that ultimately voted for gore over bush in the two zero zero zero elections were new york new jersey rhode island connecticut delaware maine vermont massachusetts washington d c pennsylvania michigan wisconsin new mexico california oregon washington illinois iowa maryland minnesota and hawaii giving gore two six seven electoral votes to bush s two seven one one of gore s electors cast a blank ballot to protest what she called dc
s colonial status thus the candidate s final number of electoral votes was two six six the florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election critics have argued that the governor of florida jeb bush brother of george w bush and the secretary of state of florida katherine harris
did play a part in ensuring that the state was in the red column of the republicans come election day several irregularities are thought to have favored bush others may have given gore an edge irregularities favoring bush included the notorious palm beach butterfly ballots which were alleged to have produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for reform party candidate pat buchanan and a purge of some five zero zero zero zero alleged felons from the florida voting rolls that included some voters who were again eligible to vote
under florida law many bush supporters however believed that an unfair advantage was given to gore when all major
news networks early on prematurely projected gore as the winner of florida s two five electoral votes at seven five two pm eastern time this happened before the polls closed in one zero florida counties in the heavily republican western
panhandle which are in the central time zone and thus closed at seven pm central time eight pm eastern some have thought that this depressed the pro bush vote in that area during the numerous recounts which made the phrase hanging chads infamous in the american vocabulary there were also allegations of both pro bush and pro gore tampering by low level operatives in the controversial counties it is unclear what effect if any this may have had and while the gore
camp fought with some success to keep overseas absentee votes out in counties thought to be pro bush bush operatives similarly albeit while drawing less attention to their efforts prevented the counting of overseas absentee votes in strong democratic counties both sides contended that the votes were cast after election day and since many of the envelopes did not have cancelled stamps it was not clear when the votes were cast reports later surfaced that many overseas voters attempted to vote only after learning of the closeness of the florida vote some commentators still see such irregularities and the legal
maneuvering around the recounts as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the vote as a matter of law however the issue was
settled albeit controversially again when the u s congress accepted florida s electoral delegation only after a challenge to the florida electors was presented in the congressional chambers on january six two zero zero one by members of the congressional black caucus member after
member went up decrying the lack of a senator who would be willing to co sponsor the challenge without any effect they thus failed to bring the challenge to a debate concern about the possible disenfranchisement of voters in the florida vote led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the united states and ultimately to the passage of the help america vote act which authorized the united states federal government to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with electronic voting equipment however this has led to new controversies because of the
security weaknesses of the computer systems the lack of paper based methods of secure verification and the necessity to rely on the
trustworthiness of the manufacturers whose employees also count those votes although gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than five zero zero zero zero zero votes he lost the election by five electoral votes with one d c elector pledged to gore casting a blank ballot to protest the district s lack of representation in congress al gore on futurama joe lieberman later criticized al gore for adopting a populist theme during their two zero zero zero campaign lieberman said he objected to gore s people vs the

inconvenient truth in april two zero zero six on february one two two zero zero six former us vice president al gore on sunday said that the us government had committed terrible abuses against
arabs living in america after nine one one attacks and that most americans did not support such treatment the thoughtless way in which visas are now handled that is a mistake mr gore said at the jeddah economic forum the worst thing we can possibly do is to cut off the channels of friendship and mutual understanding between saudi arabia and the united states the former us vice president told this saudi audience many of them educated in us universities that arabs in the united states had been indiscriminately rounded up often on minor charges of overstaying
a visa or not having a green card in proper order and held in conditions that were just unforgivable unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it s wrong i do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country terrence jeffrey of human events and jack kelly of realclearpolitics com however criticized gore s comments and pointed out that nine one one commission page four nine two reported that khalid sheikh mohammed who planned the attacks
told interrogators most of the hijackers he selected were saudis because they had the easiest time getting visas mohammad atta himself was in the united states having overstayed his visa television network al gore s current official logo on may four two zero zero four indtv holdings a company co founded by gore and joel hyatt purchased cable news channel newsworld international from vivendi universal the new network will not have political leanings gore said but will serve as an independent voice for a target audience of people

a focus on more intangible non financial factors such as social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance two zero zero four presidential election endorsing dean al gore shocked many when he did not endorse his two zero zero zero running mate joe lieberman but the outsider candidate howard dean in two zero zero three initially al gore was touted as a logical opponent of george w bush in the two zero zero four united states presidential election on december one six two zero zero two however gore announced that he would
not run in two zero zero four saying that it was time for fresh faces and new ideas to emerge from the democrats when he appeared on
a six zero minutes interview gore said that he felt if he had run the focus of the election would be the rematch rather than the issues gore s former running mate joe lieberman quickly announced his
own candidacy for the presidency which he had vowed he would not do if gore ran despite gore taking himself out of the race a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running however that effort largely came to an
end when gore publicly endorsed vermont governor howard dean over his former running mate joe lieberman weeks before the first primary of the election cycle there was still some effort to encourage write in votes for gore in the primaries by a different group of gore supporters who were separate from the draft movement although gore did receive a small number of votes in new hampshire and new mexico that effort was halted when john kerry pulled into the lead for the nomination gore s endorsement of dean was helpful to
the latter in legitimizing him in the eyes of the establishment faction of the democratic party but it also led the media to dub dean as the clear front runner with the result that his opponents devoted more of their emphasis to opposing him campaigning against bush on january one five two zero zero four al gore gave a major policy address in new york city on climate change and the bush administration s approach to the environment accompanied by slides
and projector gore slammed the bush administration s attitude towards global warming saying there are many who still do not believe that global warming is a problem at all and it s no wonder because they are the targets of a massive and well organized campaign of disinformation lavishly funded by polluters who are determined to prevent any action to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming out of a fear that their profits might be affected if they had to
stop dumping so much pollution into the atmosphere on february nine two zero zero four on the eve of the tennessee primary gore gave what many consider his harshest criticism of the president yet when he accused george w bush of betraying the country by using the nine one one attacks as a justification for the invasion
of iraq he betrayed this country mr gore shouted into the microphone he played on our fears he took america on an ill conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops an adventure preordained and planned before nine one one ever took place gore also urged all democrats to unite behind their eventual nominee proclaiming any one of these candidates is far better than george w bush in march two zero zero four gore along with former presidents bill
clinton and jimmy carter united behind kerry as the presumptive democratic nominee al gore who just four years prior accepted his party s nomination speaks as a party elder at the two zero zero four democratic national convention on april two eight two zero zero four gore announced that he would be donating six million to various democratic party groups drawing from his funds left over from his two zero zero zero presidential campaign gore pledged to donate four
million to the democratic national committee the party s senate and house committees would each get one million and the party from gore s home state of tennessee would receive two five zero zero zero zero in addition gore announced that all of the surplus funds in his recount fund from the two zero zero zero election controversy that resulted in the
supreme court halting the counting of the ballots a total of two four zero zero zero
zero will be donated to the florida democratic party in his speech gore stressed the importance of voting and having every vote counted a point that foreshadowed
the two zero zero four u s election voting controversies on may two six two zero zero four gore gave a highly critical speech on the iraq crisis and the bush administration in the speech gore demanded secretary of defense donald rumsfeld national security advisor condoleezza rice director of central intelligence george tenet deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for policy douglas feith and under secretary of defense for intelligence
stephen cambone all resign for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of americans abroad during
the fiery speech which lasted more than an hour gore called the bush administration s iraq war plan incompetent and called george w bush the most dishonest president since richard nixon who resigned the office of the presidency in one nine seven four following the watergate scandal gore also
decried the abuse of prisoners in abu ghraib prison in iraq saying
what happened at that prison it is now clear is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples it was the natural consequence of the bush administration policy convention as the first major speaker at the two zero zero four democratic national convention gore held himself out as a living reminder that every vote counts let s make sure not only that the supreme court does not pick the next president but also that this president is not the one who picks
the next supreme court said gore gore directed remarks to supporters of third party presidential candidate ralph nader who abandoned the democratic party four years ago asking them do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates post convention on october one eight two zero zero four al gore delivered his final major policy speech of the two zero zero four political season in an hour long presentation gore concluded that i m convinced that most of
the president s frequent departures from fact based analysis have much more to do with right wing political and economic ideology than with the bible views and controversies gore is a strong supporter of abortion rights free trade and strong environmental policy he was a vocal opponent of the two zero zero three
invasion of iraq gore has gradually moved politically further left he was once a moderate to conservative lawmaker while in congress gore had a strong pro life record on abortion and voted pro life two seven times when exactly gore became pro choice is unknown but by one nine eight eight when he sought the democratic presidential nomination he was on record as opposing the
criminalization of abortion critics have charged gore with illegal fundraising at a buddhist temple and illegal use of his government office and telephone for political fundraising in violation of the hatch act although he was never indicted on such a charge the internet gore is a frequent target of satire based on his supposedly having claimed to have invented the internet in fact he never made such a claim rather during an interview with wolf blitzer on cnn s late edition on march nine one nine
nine nine gore stated during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet i took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country s economic growth and environmental protection improvements in our educational system the phrase from the statement above which sparked the debate i took the initiative in creating the internet referred to gore s involvement with and sponsorship of the high performance computing
act of one nine nine one which advanced the growth and mainstreaming of the internet during the one nine nine zero s this statement was later defended by internet pioneers robert kahn and vinton cerf as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the internet work we would like to acknowledge vp gore s contributions as a congressman senator and as vice president no other elected official to our knowledge has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time accusations of hypocrisy by mcclellan and gonzales on the
one six th of january two zero zero six gore accused u s president bush of breaking the law repeatedly and insistently and called for a special investigation of nsa spying on americans because the spying was without a warrant from a special federal court that authorizes such requests to eavesdrop on americans bush press secretary scott mcclellan and attorney general alberto gonzales both responded to reporters that the clinton gore administration had done illegal warrantless physical searches themselves of aldrich ames without permission from a judge i think his
hypocrisy knows no bounds mcclellan said of gore but the foreign intelligence surveillance act at the time did not cover physical searches the
law had changed in one nine nine five gore claimed that because
gonzales made a political defense for bush he was no longer eligible to review charges against bush and therefore must name a special
counsel his charges are factually wrong said gore both before and after the foreign intelligence surveillance act was amended in one nine nine five the clinton gore administration complied fully and completely with the terms of the law see

from tennessee united states senators from tennessee vice presidents of the united states vietnam war veterans animal farm book cover animal farm is a satirical novel which can also be understood as a modern fable or allegory by george
orwell ostensibly about a group of animals who oust the humans from the farm they live on and run it themselves only to have it corrupted into a brutal tyranny on its own it was written during world war ii and published in one nine four five although it was not widely successful until the late one nine five
zero s animal farm is a thinly veiled critique and satire of soviet totalitarianism many events in the book are
based on events from the soviet union during the stalin era orwell though a leftist he was for many years a member of the independent labour party was a critic of stalin and suspicious of moscow directed communism after his experiences in the spanish civil war plot when the farm s prize winning pig
old major calls a meeting of all the animals of manor farm he tells them that he has had a dream in which mankind is gone and animals are free to live in peace and harmony he compares the humans to parasites and then proceeds to teach the
animals a revolutionary song beasts of england the other animals begin to hope and dream for the revolution of such a day when old major dies a mere three days later three pigs snowball who teaches the animals to read napoleon and squealer assume
command and turn his dream into a full fledged philosophy one night the starved animals suddenly revolt and drive the farmer mr jones his wife and his pet raven off the farm and take control the farm is renamed animal farm as the animals work towards a future utopia the seven commandments of the new philosophy of animalism are written on the wall
of a barn for all to read the seventh and most important of which is that all animals are equal all animals work but the workhorse boxer
does more than his fair share and adopts a maxim of his own i will work harder animal farm is off to a great start snowball teaches
the other animals to read and write though few animals besides the pigs learn to read well food is plentiful due to a good harvest and the entire farm is organized and running smoothly even when mr jones tries his last ditch effort to retake control of the farm the animals easily defeat him at what they later call the battle of the cowshed soon however things begin to unravel as napoleon and snowball begin an epic power struggle over the farm when snowball announces his idea for a
windmill napoleon quickly opposes it a meeting is held and when snowball makes his passionate and articulate speech in favour of the windmill napoleon only makes a brief retort and then makes a strange noise to call in nine attack dogs they burst
in and chase snowball off of the farm in his absence napoleon declares himself the leader of the farm and makes instant changes he announces that meetings will no longer be held as before and a committee of pigs alone will decide what happens with the farm napoleon changes his mind
about the windmill claiming through squealer that snowball stole the idea from him
and the animals begin to work after a violent storm the animals wake to find the fruit of their
months of labour utterly annihilated though neighbouring farmers scoff at the thin walls napoleon and squealer convince everyone that snowball destroyed it napoleon begins to purge the farm killing many animals he accuses of consorting with snowball in the meantime
boxer takes a second mantra napoleon is always right napoleon begins to abuse his powers even more and life on the farm becomes harder and harder for the rest of the animals the pigs impose more and more controls on them while reserving privileges for themselves history is rewritten to villainise snowball and glorify napoleon even further each step of this development is justified by the pig squealer who on several
occasions alters the seven commandments on the barn in the dead of night the song beasts of england is banned as inappropriate now that the dream of animal farm has been realised and is replaced by an anthem glorifying napoleon who begins to live more and more like a human the animals though cold starving and overworked remain convinced that they are still better off than when they
were ruled by a man named jones mr frederick one of the two neighbouring farmers swindles napoleon by paying with forged banknotes and then attacks the farm
and uses dynamite to blow up the recently restored windmill though the animals of animal farm eventually win the battle they do so at a great cost as
many of the animals including boxer are wounded however boxer continues to work harder and harder until he finally collapses while working on the windmill napoleon sends for a van to come and take boxer to the veterinarian but as boxer is loaded up and the van drives away the animals read what is written on the side of the van alfred simmonds horse slaughterer and glue boiler squealer quickly
reports that the van with the old writing has been purchased by the hospital and later that boxer has died in the hospital in spite of the best medical care many years pass and the pigs learn to walk upright carry whips and wear clothes the seven commandments are reduced to a single phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs
and the humans of the area in the adjacent foxwood farm run by mr pilkington he announces his alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both worlds the animals discover this when they overhear napoleon s conversations and finally realize that a change has come over the ruling pigs during a poker match an argument breaks out between napoleon and mr pilkington when they both play an ace of spades and the animals realise how they cannot tell
the difference between the pigs and the humans the pigs walked on two feet and they adopted many of mr jones customs and principles the pigs have violated every one of the rules set out in the beginning which they set up this is when we come to the theme of this book power corrupts
plot references to real events the ousting of the humans after the farmers forget to feed the animals russian revolution of one nine one seven led to the removal of the tsars after a series of famine and poverty the refusal of the humans to refer to animal farm
by its new name still calling it manor farm may be
indicative of the diplomatic limbo in which the soviets existed following their early history mr jones last ditch effort to re take the farm the battle of the cowshed russian civil war in which the western capitalist governments sent soldiers to try to remove the bolsheviks from power napoleon s removal of snowball stalin s removal of leon trotsky from power in one nine two seven and his subsequent expulsion napoleon
stealing snowball s idea for a windmill stalin later shifted away from world socialism to socialism in one country which trotsky had originally promoted the windmill can also be considered a symbol of the soviet five year plans a concept developed by trotsky and adopted by stalin who claimed them to be his idea moses the raven leaving the farm for a while and then returning similar to the russian orthodox
church going underground and then being brought back to give the workers hope boxer s motto napoleon is always right is strikingly similar to mussolini is always right a chant used to hail benito mussolini during his rule of italy from one nine two two to one nine
four three during the rise of napoleon he ordered the collection of all the hens eggs in an act of defiance the hens destroyed their eggs rather than give them to napoleon during stalin s collectivization period in the early one nine three zero s many ukrainian peasants burned their crops and farms rather than handing them over to the government napoleon s mass executions of which many were unfair for the alleged crimes stalin executed his political enemies for various crimes after they were tortured and forced to falsely confess the four
pigs that go against napoleon s will represent the white movement napoleon s replacement of the farm anthem beasts of england with an inane composition by the pig poet minimus animal farm animal farm never through
me will you come to harm in one nine four three stalin replaced the old national anthem the internationale with the hymn of the soviet union the old internationale glorified the revolution and the people the original version of the hymn of the soviet union glorified stalin so heavily that after his death in one nine five three entire sections of the anthem had to be replaced or removed orwell could have also been referring to napoleon bonaparte s banning
of the french national hymn la marseillaise in one seven nine nine napoleon s dealing with mr frederick who eventually betrays animal farm and
destroys the windmill though animal farm repels the human attack many animals are wounded and killed stalin
s molotov ribbentrop pact with nazi germany in one nine three nine which was later betrayed in one nine four one when hitler invaded the soviet union though the soviet union won the war it came at a tremendous price of roughly eight five one five million soviet soldiers unconfirmed and many civilians coming to an incredible estimated two zero million dead as well as the utter destruction of the western soviet union and its prized
collective farms which stalin had created in the one nine three zero
s napoleon s later alliance with the humans stalin s non aggression pact with hitler
in the early years of wwii napoleon s changing animal farm back
to manor the red army s name was changed from the workers and peasants red army to the soviet army to appear as a more appealing and professional organization rather than an army of the common people after old major dies his skull is placed on display on a tree stump similarly lenin s whom old major is based on along with karl marx embalmed body was put on display in lenin s tomb
in red square postmortem where it still remains squealer constantly changing the commandments is said to be a reference to a perversion in russian religious history as observed by
leo tolstoy when the essential precepts of the sermon on the mount were altered by russian orthodox church it may also refer to the revision of history texts to glorify stalin during his regime characters the events and characters in animal farm are all carefully drawn to represent the history of the soviet union orwell makes this explicit in the case of napoleon whom he directly connects to stalin in a letter of one seven march one nine four five
to the publisher when the windmill is blown up i wrote all the animals including napoleon flung themselves on their faces i would like to alter it to all the animals except napoleon if that
has been printed it s not worth bothering about but i just thought the alteration would be fair to js joseph stalin as he did stay in moscow
during the german advance the other characters have their analogies in the real world but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do
not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts the pigs napoleon the pig who becomes the leader of animal farm post rebellion created based on the actions of joseph stalin he uses his military of nine attack dogs to cement his power through fear napoleon craftily drives out his opponent snowball snowball the pig who fights napoleon for control post rebellion inspired by leon trotsky snowball is a passionate intellectual and is far more honest about his motives than napoleon snowball easily wins the loyalty of most of the animals trotsky was
driven into exile in mexico where he was assassinated squealer the pig who
serves as public speaker inspired by vyacheslav molotov and the russian paper pravda squealer twists and abuses the language to excuse justify and
extol napoleon s actions no matter how egregious all his life george orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language squealer limits the debate by complicating it and he confuses and disorients making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly to squeal is to betray something squealer does often to his fellow animals minimus a poet pig
who writes a song about napoleon representing admirers of stalin both inside and outside the ussr such as maxim gorky old major as a fellow socialist orwell agreed with some of karl marx s politics and even respected vladimir lenin in
fact the satire in animal farm is not of marxism or lenin s revolution but of the corruption that occurred later major who is based upon both lenin and marx is the inspiration which fuels the rest of the book though it is a positive image orwell does slip some flaws in old major such as how during his complaints about the abuse of animals he admits that he has been largely
free from those terrors pinkeye a small piglet who tastes napoleon s food for poisoning piglets while not truly noted in the novel these piglets are hinted to be the children of napoleon and are the first generation of animals to actually be subjugated to his idea of animal inequality the humans mr jones the original owner of manor farm he is probably based on tsar nicholas ii mr frederick the tough owner of pinchfield a well kept neighbouring farm he is probably based on germany and or adolf hitler mr pilkington the easy going but crafty owner of foxwood
a neighbouring farm he represents britain and or winston churchill mr whymper a human whom napoleon hires to represent animal farm in human society he is loosely based on george bernard shaw who visited the ussr in one nine three one and praised what he found the other animals boxer possibly one of the more popular characters boxer is the tragic avatar of the working class
or proletariat loyal dedicated and strong his major flaw however is his blind trust of the leaders and his inability to see corruption he is used and abused by the pigs as much or more than he was by jones his death serves to show just how far the pigs are willing to go a strong and loyal draft horse boxer played a huge part in keeping the farm together prior to his death boxer could
also represent a stakhanovite his name is a reference to the boxer rebellion clover boxer s close friend and also a draft horse she blames herself for forgetting the original seven commandments when squealer revises them
she represents the middle class educated people who acquiesce to the subversion of principles by the powerful mollie a horse who likes wearing ribbons which represent luxury and being pampered by humans she represents upper class people the bourgeoisie who fled from the u s s r after the russian revolution benjamin a donkey who
is cynical about the revolution he is said to be inspired by orwell himself he represented the skeptical people in and out of russia who believed that communism would not help the people of russia moses a tame raven who spreads stories of sugarcandy mountain the
animal heaven these beliefs are denounced by the pigs moses represents religion specifically the russian orthodox church which has always been in conflict with communism it is interesting to note that while moses initially leaves the farm after the
rebellion he later returns and is supported by the pigs this represents the cynical use of religion by the state to anaesthetise the minds of the masses muriel a goat who reads the edited commandments she may represent intelligent labour jessie and bluebell two dogs who give birth in chapter iii their puppies are nurtured by napoleon to inspire fear without doubt representing the formation of the nkvd kgb the hens represent the kulaks landed peasants persecuted by stalin the dogs napoleon s secret police
and bodyguards inspired by cheka nkvd ogpu mvd the sheep the sheep show the dumb animal following of the proletariats in the midst of the russian civil war four legs good two legs bad significance the book is an allegory about the events following the revolution in the soviet union and in particular the rise of stalinism and
the betrayal of the revolution which basically replaced one dictatorship for another orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the spanish civil war which are described in another of his books homage to catalonia he intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals in which he believed and continued to believe after he saw a revolution betrayed as in spain for the preface of a ukrainian edition he prepared in
one nine four seven orwell describes what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm i saw a little boy perhaps ten years old driving a huge cart horse along a narrow path whipping it whenever it tried to turn it struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat this ukrainian edition was
an early propaganda use of the book it was printed to be distributed among the soviet citizens of ukraine who were just some of the many millions of displaced persons throughout europe at the end of the second world war the american occupation forces did not appreciate these illegal presses printing propaganda and confiscated one five zero zero copies of animal farm handing them to the soviet authorities the politics in the book also affected britain with orwell reporting that ernest bevin was terrified that it may cause embarrassment if published before
the one nine four five general election in recent years the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organization only to become corrupt and oppressive themselves over time as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it such analogies have been used for many former african colonies such as zimbabwe and democratic republic of congo whose succeeding african born rulers were thought to be as corrupt as the european colonists they supplanted in schools animal farm is used in the
core knowledge curriculum core knowledge is based on the interaction of different subjects in schools the way animal farm comes into play is that if a student s geography or history class is learning about the former soviet union the english class will be reading animal farm post publication views of the book in the post war years it became apparent to orwell that anti russian literature was
not something which most major publishing houses would touch including his regular publisher gollancz one publisher he sought to sell his book to rejected it on the grounds of government advice although it was later found that the civil servant who gave the order was a soviet spy orwell originally prepared a preface on freedom of the press for the book which noted the sinister fact about literary censorship in england is that it is largely voluntary things are kept right out of the british press not because the government intervened but because of a general tacit
agreement that it wouldn t do to mention that particular fact somewhat ironically the preface itself was censored and is not published with most copies of the book film versions the book was the basis of an animated feature film in one nine five five britain s first full length animated movie directed by john halas and joy batchelor and quietly commissioned by the american cia which softened
the theme of the story slightly by reducing the role of moses the character representing religion and adding an epilogue that occurs immediately after the novel s

magazine one zero zero best novels twentieth century british novels amphibians class amphibia are a taxon of animals that include all tetrapods four legged vertebrates that do not have amniotic eggs amphibians from greek both and life generally spend part of their time on land but they do not have the adaptations to an entirely terrestrial existence found in most other modern tetrapods amniotes there are about five nine five zero described living species of amphibians the study
of amphibians and reptiles is known as herpetology history of amphibians fire salamander salamandra salamandra amphibians developed with the characteristics of pharyngeal slits gills a dorsal nerve cord a notochord and a post anal tail at different stages of their life they have persisted since the dawn of tetrapods three nine zero million years ago in the devonian period when they were the first four legged
animals to develop lungs during the following carboniferous period they also developed the ability to walk on land to avoid aquatic competition and predation while allowing them to travel from water source to water source as a group they maintained the status of the dominant animal for nearly seven five million years throughout
their history they have ranged in size from the three foot nine zero cm long devonian ichthyostega to the slightly larger five foot one five zero cm long permian eryops and down to the tiny brachycephalus didactylus brazilian gold frog and eleutherodactylus iberia from cuba with a total length of nine six nine eight millimeters zero four inches amphibians have mastered almost every climate on earth from the hottest deserts to the frozen arctic classification caecilian from the san antonio zoo traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all
tetrapods that are not amniotes recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these called the lissamphibia recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class amphibia to the lissamphibia i e to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles birds and mammals there are two ancient extinct subclasses subclass labyrinthodontia paraphyletic subclass lepospondyli of the remaining modern subclass lissamphibia there are three orders order anura frogs and toads in superorder salientia five two two eight species
order caudata or urodela salamanders five five two species order gymnophiona or apoda caecilians one seven one species authorities disagree on whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a sub order of the order salientia in effect salientia includes all the anura plus a single triassic proto frog species triadobatrachus massinoti practical considerations seem to
favour using the former arrangement now reproduction for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians are bound to fresh water a few tolerate brackish water but there are no true sea water amphibians several hundred
frog species in adaptive radiations e g eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantines the australo papuan microhylids and
many other tropical frogs however do not need any water whatsoever they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult bypassing the tadpole stage
entirely several species have also adapted to arid and semi arid environments but most of them still need water to lay their eggs symbiosis with single celled algae that lives in the jelly like layer of the
eggs has evolved several times the larvae tadpoles or polliwogs breathe with exterior gills after hatching they start to transform gradually into the adult s appearance this process is called metamorphosis typically the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults but there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction the most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land but
there are several other changes the gills are replaced by other respiratory organs i e lungs the skin
changes and develops glands to avoid dehydration the eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water an eardrum is developed to lock the middle ear in frogs and toads the tail

of amphibian declines formerly abundant it was last seen in one nine eight nine dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted in the past two decades from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived as one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change
and disease however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and amphibian declines are currently a topic of much ongoing research see also frog zoology prehistoric amphibian tetrapod references duellman trueb biology of amphibians coauthors mart n r bustamante luis a coloma jamie a consuegra michael p l fogden

likely ranked the fourth smallest state population wise in the u s with wyoming vermont and by now north dakota smaller than alaska the name alaska is most likely derived from the aleut word alyeska meaning greater land as opposed to the aleut word aleutia meaning lesser
land to the aleuts this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the mainland from an island it is
bordered by yukon territory and british columbia canada to the east the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the beaufort sea and the arctic ocean to the north alaska is the largest state by area in the united states it is larger in area than all but one eight of
the world s nations history alaska was first inhabited by humans who came across the bering land bridge eventually alaska became populated by the inupiaq inuit and yupik eskimos aleuts and a variety of american indian groups most if not all of the pre columbian population of the americas probably took this route and continued further south and east the first written accounts indicate that the first europeans to reach alaska
came from russia vitus bering sailed east and saw mt st elias
the russian american company hunted sea otters for their fur the colony was
never very profitable because of the costs of transportation at the urging of u s secretary of state william seward the united states senate approved the purchase of alaska from russia for seven two zero zero zero zero zero approximately one three four zero zero zero zero zero zero in two zero

by friday october one eight one eight six seven two fridays in a row because of the date line shift the first american administrator of alaska was polish immigrant w odzimierz krzy anowski the purchase was not popular in the contiguous united states where alaska became known

japanese troops it was the only territory within the current borders of the united states to have land occupied during the war politics alaska is often characterized as a republican leaning state with strong libertarian tendencies local political communities often work on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights as many residents are proud of their rough alaskan heritage alaska natives while organized in and around their communities are often active within the native corporations which have been given ownership over
large tracts of land and thus need to deliberate resource conservation and development issues in presidential elections the state s electoral college votes have been most often won by a republican nominee only once has alaska supported a democratic nominee when it supported lyndon b
johnson in the landslide year of one nine six four although the one nine six zero and one nine six eight elections were close no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times president george w bush won the state s electoral votes in two zero zero four by a margin of two five percentage points with six one one of the vote juneau stands out as an area
that supports democratic candidates when the united states congress in one nine five seven and one nine five eight debated the wisdom of admitting it as the four nine th state much of the political debate centered on whether alaska would become a democratic or republican leaning state
conventional wisdom had it that with its rugged individualism penchant for new ideas and dependence on the federal government largess for basic needs it would become a democratic stronghold about which republicans and the then republican administration of dwight eisenhower had reservations given time those fears proved roundly unfounded after an early flirtatious period with liberal politics the political climate of alaska changed quickly
once petroleum was discovered and the federal government came to be seen as meddling in local affairs still despite its libertarian leanings the state regularly takes in more federal money than it gives out a fact that can be attributed at least partially to its equal representation in the united states senate in recent years the alaska legislature is a two zero member senate serving four year terms and four zero member house serving two year terms it has been dominated by conservatives generally republicans likewise recent state governors have been mostly conservatives although not always
elected under the official party banner republican wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in one nine nine zero after jumping the republican ship and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected he subsequently officially rejoined the republican fold in one

the u s senate to run for governor republican frank murkowski held the state s other senatorial position and as governor was allowed to appoint his daughter lisa murkowski as his successor she won a full six year term on her own in two zero zero four alaska s sole u s house representative don young won re election to his one seven th
straight term also in two zero zero four his seniority in house ranks him as one of the most influential republican house members his position on the house transportation committee allowed him to parlay some four five zero million to two bridge projects in alaska named the bridges to

not bordered by another us state hawaii being the other it is the
only state that is both in north america and is not part of the four eight contiguous states about five zero zero miles eight zero zero
kilometers of canadian territory separate alaska from washington therefore alaska is an exclave of the united states that is part of
the continental u s but is not part of the contiguous u s it is also the only mainland state whose capital city is accessible only via ship or air there are no
roads connecting juneau to the rest of the state alaska is the largest state in the united states in terms of land area five seven zero three seven four square miles one
four seven seven two six one km if a map of alaska were superimposed upon a map of the continental united states alaska would overlap texas oklahoma kansas new mexico and colorado alaska has the longest coastline of
any state one scheme for describing the state s geography is by labeling the regions south central alaska is the southern coastal region and is the population center for the state the municipality of anchorage and many small but growing towns such as palmer and wasilla lie within this
area petroleum industrial plants transportation tourism and two military bases form the core of the economy here the alaska panhandle also known as southeast alaska is home to juneau many small towns tidewater glaciers and extensive forests tourism fishing forestry and state government anchor the economy the alaska interior is home to fairbanks the geography is marked by large braided rivers such as the yukon river and the kuskokwim river as well as arctic tundra lands and shorelines the alaskan bush is the remote less crowded part of the state encompassing
three eight zero native villages and small towns such as nome bethel kotzebue and most famously barrow the northernmost town in the united states the northeast corner of alaska is covered by the arctic national wildlife refuge which covers one nine zero four nine two three six acres seven nine three one eight km with its numerous islands alaska has nearly three four zero zero zero miles five four seven zero zero km of tidal shoreline the island chain extending west from the southern tip of
the alaska peninsula is called the aleutian islands many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians for example unimak island is home to mount shishaldin a moderately active volcano that rises to nine nine eight zero ft three zero four two m above sea level the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland north america s second largest tides occur in turnagain arm just south of anchorage
which often sees tidal differences of more than three five feet one zero seven m alaska is home to three five million lakes of two zero acres eight ha or larger marshlands and wetland permafrost cover one eight eight three two zero square miles four eight seven seven four seven km mostly in northern western and southwest

areas are artificial divisions defined by the united states census bureau for statistical purposes only areas of the state not in organized boroughs compose what the government of alaska calls the unorganized borough borough level government services in the unorganized borough are provided by the state itself economy greetings from alaska the state s two zero zero three total gross state product was three one billion its per capita income for two zero

in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in both fairbanks and anchorage its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and
wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous four eight states this has changed for the most part in anchorage and fairbanks where the cost of living is actually less than some major cities in the lower
four eight thanks to lower housing and transportation costs the introduction of big box stores in anchorage fairbanks and juneau also did much to lower prices however rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure many rural residents come in to these cities and purchase food and
goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like costco and sam s club some have embraced
the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities if they are available at all transportation bridge on alaska highway between watson lake and whitehorse alaska is arguably the least connected state in terms of road transportation the state s road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road which has spurred several debates over the
decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system one unique feature of the road system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel which links the seward highway south of anchorage with the relatively isolated community of whittier the tunnel held the title of the
longest road tunnel in north america at nearly two five miles four km until completion of the three five mile five six km interstate nine three tunnel as part of the big dig project in boston massachusetts the anderson tunnel combines a one lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing consequently eastbound traffic westbound traffic and the alaska railroad must share the
tunnel resulting in waits of two zero minutes or more to enter as reflected on the alaska department of transportation tunnel website it is now considered north america s longest railroad highway tunnel the alaska railroad runs from seward through anchorage denali and fairbanks to north pole with spurs to whittier and palmer the railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving alaska s natural resources such as coal and gravel to ports in
anchorage whittier and seward the alaska railroad is the only remaining railroad in north america to use cabooses on its freight trains a stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area most cities and villages in the state are accessible only by sea or air alaska has a well developed ferry system known as the alaska marine highway which serves the cities of southeast and the alaska peninsula the
system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington up the inside passage to skagway cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air accounting for alaska s extremely well developed bush air services an alaskan novelty anchorage itself and to a lesser extent fairbanks are serviced by many major airlines air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state
anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism unofficial sources have estimated the numbers for two zero zero four at
some four million tourists arriving in alaska between may and september however regular flights to most villages and towns within the state are commercially challenging to provide alaska airlines is the only major
airline offering in state travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing seven three seven two zero zero s from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines like era aviation penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular
aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires seven zero of that subsidy to go to carriers who
offer passenger service to the communities but perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the world s busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage
international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and lots of items from stores and warehouse clubs another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is
the iditarod a one one five zero mile one eight five
zero km trail from anchorage to nome the race commemorates the famous one nine two five serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like balto took much needed medicine to the diphtheria stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige demographics as of two zero zero five alaska has an estimated population of six six three six six one which is an increase of five nine zero six or zero nine from the prior year
and an increase of three six seven three zero or five nine since the year two zero zero zero this includes a natural increase since the last census of three six five nine

contributing to the high rate of suicides this is a controversial topic for many residents alaska has also had a problem with brain drain as many of its young people including most of the highest academic achievers leave the state upon graduating high school while for many this functions as a sort of
walkabout many do not return to the state the university of alaska has been successfully combating this by offering four year scholarships to the top one zero percent of alaska high school graduates the alaska scholars program domestic
abuse and other violent crimes are also at notoriously high levels in the state this is in part linked to alcohol abuse

two zero greatest engineering achievements of the two zero th century early in the century it took one american farmer to produce food for two five people where today due to engineering technology also plant breeding and agrichemicals a single farmer can feed over one three zero people this comes at a
cost however of large amounts of energy input from unsustainable mostly fossil fuel sources animal husbandry means breeding and raising
animals for meat or to harvest animal products like milk eggs or wool on a continual basis in recent years some aspects of industrial intensive agriculture have been the subject of increasing discussion the widening sphere of influence held by large seed and chemical companies meat packers and food processors has been a source of concern both within the farming community and for the general public there has been increased activity of some people against some farming practices raising chickens for food being one example another issue is the type of feed given to some
animals that can cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle there has
also been concern because of the disastrous effect that intensive agriculture has on the environment in the us for example fertilizer has been running off into the mississippi for years and has caused a dead spot in the gulf of mexico where the mississippi empties intensive agriculture also depletes the fertility of the land over time and the end effect is
that which happened in the middle east were some of the most fertile farmland in the world was turned into a desert by intensive agriculture the patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using genetic engineering has allowed seed to be licensed to farmers in much the same way that computer software is licensed to users this has changed the balance of power in favor of the seed companies allowing them to dictate terms and conditions previously unheard of some argue
these companies are guilty of biopiracy soil conservation and nutrient management have been important concerns since the one nine five zero s with the best farmers taking a stewardship role with the land they operate however increasing contamination of waterways and wetlands by nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are of concern in
many countries increasing consumer awareness of agricultural issues has led to the rise of community supported agriculture local food movement slow food and commercial organic farming though these yet remain fledgling industries history ancient egyptian farmer main article history of agriculture archaeobotanists paleoethnobotanists have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics such as a semi tough rachis and larger seeds to just after the younger dryas about nine five zero zero bc in the early holocene in the levant region of the fertile crescent

agriculture includes large scale intensive cultivation of land mono cropping organised irrigation and use of a specialized labour force the title inventors of agriculture would fall to the sumerians starting ca five five zero zero bc intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit the ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose
activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies the agriculturalism of the sumerians allowed them to embark on an unprecedented territorial expansion making them the first empire builders not long after the egyptians powered by effective farming of the nile valley achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the sumerian empire in area the invention of a three field system of crop rotation during the middle ages vastly improved agricultural efficiency after one
four nine two the world s agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the columbian exchange crops and animals that were previously only known in the old world were now transplanted to the new and vice versa perhaps most notably the tomato became a favorite in european cuisine while certain wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native north central and south americans by the early one
eight zero zero s agricultural practices particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages and before especially in the largely virgin lands of north and south america with the rapid rise of mechanization in the two zero th century especially in the form of the tractor the demanding tasks of sowing

one eight nine four november two two one nine six three was a british writer who emigrated to the united states he was a member of the famous huxley family who produced a number of brilliant scientific minds best known for his novels and wide ranging output of essays he also published short stories poetry travel writing and film stories and scripts through his novels and essays huxley functioned as an examiner and sometimes critic of social mores societal norms and ideals and
possible misapplications of science in human life while his earlier concerns might be called humanist ultimately he became quite interested in spiritual subjects like parapsychology and mystically based philosophy which he also wrote about by the end of his life huxley
was considered in certain circles a leader of modern thought biography early years
family tree huxley was born in godalming surrey england he was the son of the writer leonard huxley by his first wife julia arnold and grandson of thomas henry huxley one of the most important naturalists of the one nine th century a man known as darwin s bulldog his brother julian huxley was a biologist also noted for his evolutionary theories huxley understandably excelled in the areas he took up professionally for on his father s side were a number of noted men of science while on his mother s were people of literary accomplishment huxley was a
lanky delicately framed child who was gifted intellectually his father was a professional herbalist as well as an author so aldous began his learning in his father s well equipped botanical laboratory then continued in a school named hillside which his
mother supervised for several years until she became terminally ill from the age of nine aldous was then educated in the british boarding school system he took readily to the handling of ideas his mother julia died in one nine zero eight when aldous was only fourteen and his sister roberta died of an unrelated incident in the same month three years later aldous suffered an illness keratitis punctata which seriously damaged his eyesight his older brother trev committed suicide in one nine one four aldous s near blindness disqualified him from service in world war
i once his eyesight recovered he was able to read english literature at balliol college oxford where he was a member of the cambridge apostles maturing as a lean young man well over six feet in height the cerebrotonic huxley s initial interest in literature was primarily intellectual while he was noted for his personal kindliness only considerably later some say under the influence of such friends as d h lawrence did he
heartily embrace feelings as matters of importance in his evolving personal philosophy and literary expression following his education at balliol huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living for a short while in one nine one eight he was employed acquiring provisions at the air ministry but never desiring a career in administration or in business huxley s lack of inherited means propelled him into applied literary work huxley had completed his first unpublished novel at the age of seventeen and began writing seriously in his early twenties he wrote
great novels on dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously brave new
world and on pacifist themes e g eyeless in gaza huxley was strongly influenced by f matthias alexander and included him as a character in eyeless in gaza middle years already a noted satirist and social thinker during
world war i huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor home of lady ottoline morrell later in crome yellow one nine two one he caricatured the garsington lifestyle he married maria nys whom he had met at garsington they had one child matthew who grew up to be an epidemiologist huxley moved to hollywood california in one nine three seven with his wife and friend gerald heard heard introduced huxley to vedanta and meditating in huxley s one nine three seven book ends and means most
people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of liberty peace justice and brotherly love though they haven t been able to agree on how to achieve it his book goes
on to explore why the confusion or disagreement is there and what might be done about it in one nine three eight huxley befriended j krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired he also became a vedantist in the circle of swami prabhavananda and he also introduced christopher isherwood to this circle not long after huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed teachings of the world s
great mystics for most of his life since the illness in his teens which left huxley nearly blind his eyesight was poor despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at oxford around one nine
three nine he heard of the bates method for natural vision improvement and of a teacher margaret corbett who was able to teach him in the method he claimed his sight improved dramatically as a result of
using the method then later wrote a book about it the art of seeing which was published in one nine four two us one nine four three uk he reported that for the first time in over two five years he was able to read without spectacles and without strain he was a screenwriter for the one nine four zero
production of pride and prejudice later years after world war ii huxley applied for united states citizenship but was denied because he would not say he would take up arms to defend america he became a vegetarian thereafter his works were strongly influenced by mysticism and his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug mescaline to which he was introduced by the psychiatrist humphry osmond in one nine five three his years on psychoactive drugs were described as a paradise washed down with bourbon generally he was a
pioneer of self directed psychedelic drug use in a search for enlightenment famously taking one zero zero micrograms of lsd as he lay dying huxley s psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays the doors of perception the title deriving from some lines in the book the marriage of heaven
and hell by william blake and heaven and hell the title of the former became the inspiration for the naming of the rock band the doors some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early hippies huxley s main interest was not in just anything vague mysterious or subjective but in what is sometimes termed higher mysticism he liked the term perennial philosophy
that he used as the title of his noted book on the topic during the one nine five zero s huxley s interest in the related field of psychical research grew keener huxley s wife maria died of breast cancer in one nine five five and in one nine five six he remarried to laura archera who was herself an author and who wrote a biography of aldous in one nine six zero huxley was diagnosed with throat cancer in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave
lectures on human potentialities at the esalen institute in one nine five nine huxley who remained a british citizen turned down an offer of a knight bachelor by the macmillan government his ideas were foundational to the forming of the human potential movement he was also invited to speak at several prestigious american universities at a speech given in one nine six one at the california medical school in
san francisco huxley warned there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it an idea not dissimilar to his contemporary writer j b priestley s idea in the magicians huxley s views on the proper roles of science and technology as he portrayed these say in island are akin to
some other noted english and american thinkers of the twentieth century such as lewis mumford and huxley s friend gerald heard and in some ways buckminster fuller and e f schumacher clearly these men found descendants in some significant movers of a younger generation e g stewart brand via gerald heard huxley was introduced to the young huston smith who went on to become a prolific and famous scholar on the religions of man the two friends acquianted smith with vedanta and meditative practice later while huxley
was a guest professor at m i t he made introductions between smith and timothy leary that lead to epiphanies smith covers in his later book cleansing of the doors of perception amongst humanists huxley was considered
an intellectual s intellectual although his financial circumstances had forced him to churn out articles and books his thinking
and best writing earned him an exalted esteem his books were frequently on the required reading lists of english and modern philosophy courses in american colleges and universities he was one of the twentieth century thinkers honoured in the scribners publishing s leaders of modern thought
series a volume of biography and literary criticism by philip thody aldous huxley death and afterwards on his deathbed unable to speak he made a written request to his wife for lsd one zero zero g i m she obliged and he died peacefully the following morning november two two one nine six three media coverage of his death was overshadowed by
news of the assassination of president john f kennedy which occurred on the same day as did the death of the irish author c s lewis in all of huxley s mature writings one finds an awareness that seems to bridge the gap between the two cultures the sciences and the humanities this gulf posed a potentially enormous problem one that was recognized by other thinkers during huxley s lifetime such as c p snow the interest among professors of
humanities and liberal arts in huxley s work both during the writer s lifetime and afterwards rests on this consciousness on the part of the author and of course on the artful and often humorous way in which he expressed himself huxley s satirical dystopian and utopian novels seldom fail to stimulate thought the same may be said for his essays and essay collections perhaps his main message is the tragedy that frequently follows from egocentrism self centredness and selfishness films huxley wrote many screenplays and many of his novels were later adapted for
film or television notable works include the original screenplay for disney s animated alice in wonderland two productions of brave new world one of point counter point one of eyeless in gaza and one of ape and essence he was one of the screenwriters for the one nine four zero version of pride and prejudice and co

attached to the structure extending upwards in the lower right quarter algae singular alga encompass several different groups of living organisms that capture light energy through photosynthesis converting inorganic substances into simple sugars using the captured energy algae have been traditionally regarded as simple plants and some are closely related to the higher plants others appear to represent different protist
groups alongside other organisms that are traditionally considered more animal like
that is protozoa thus algae do not represent a single evolutionary direction or line but a level of organization that may have developed several times in the early history of life on earth algae range from single celled organisms to multi cellular organisms some with fairly complex differentiated form and if marine called seaweeds all lack leaves roots flowers and other organ structures that characterize higher plants they are distinguished from other protozoa in that they are photoautotrophic although this is not a hard and fast distinction as some groups contain members that are mixotrophic deriving energy both
from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have reduced or lost their photosynthetic apparatus all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the cyanobacteria and so produce oxygen as a by product
of photosynthesis unlike non cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria algae are usually found in damp places or bodies of water and thus are common in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments however terrestrial algae are usually rather inconspicuous and far more common in moist tropical regions than dry ones because algae lack vascular tissues and other adaptions to live on land algae can endure dryness and other conditions in symbiosis with a fungus as lichen the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column called phytoplankton provide the
food base for most marine food chains in very high densities so called algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete or poison other life forms seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters some are used as human food or harvested for useful substances such as agar or fertilizer the study of algae is called phycology or algology relationships among algal groups prokaryotic algae traditionally the cyanobacteria have been included among the algae referred to as
the cyanophytes or blue green algae the term algae refers
to any aquatic organisms capable of photosynthesis though some recent treatises on algae specifically exclude them cyanobacteria are some of the oldest organisms to appear in the fossil record dating back about three eight billion years precambrian ancient cyanobacteria likely produced much of the oxygen in the earth s atmosphere cyanobacteria can be unicellular colonial or filamentous they have a prokaryotic cell structure typical of
bacteria and conduct photosynthesis directly within the cytoplasm rather than in specialized organelles some filamentous blue green algae have specialized cells termed heterocysts in which nitrogen fixation occurs eukaryotic algae all other algae are eukaryotes and conduct photosynthesis within membrane bound structures organelles called chloroplasts chloroplasts contain dna and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial endosymbionts the exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among the different lines of algae reflecting different endosymbiotic events there are three groups archaeplastida that have primary chloroplasts green algae together with higher plants red algae glaucophytes in
these groups the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and probably
developed through a single endosymbiosis the chloroplasts of red algae have a more or less typical cyanobacterial pigmentation while those of the green alga have chloroplasts with chlorophyll a and b the latter found in some cyanobacteria and not most higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them two other groups of algae have green chloroplasts containing chlorophyll b euglenids and chlorarachniophytes these are surrounded by three and four membranes respectively and were probably retained from
an ingested green alga those of the chlorarchniophytes contain a small nucleomorph which is the remnant of the alga s nucleus it has been suggested that the euglenid chloroplasts only have three membranes because they were acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis the remaining algae all have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic
similarities with the red algae suggest a relationship there these groups include heterokonts e g golden algae diatoms brown algae haptophytes e g coccolithophores cryptomonads dinoflagellates in the first three of these groups chromista the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but there is considerable diversity in chloroplasts among the group as some members have acquired theirs from different sources the
apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids though not actual chloroplasts which appear to have a common origin with those of the dinoflagellates note many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost them entirely forms of algae most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and non motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may
occur in the life cycle of a species are colonial small regular groups of motile cells capsoid individual non motile cells embedded in mucilage coccoid individual non motile cells with cell walls palmelloid non motile cells embedded in mucilage filamentous a string of non motile cells connected together sometimes branching parenchymatous cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues
in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached leading to organisms with full tissue differentiation these are the brown algae some of which may reach seven zero m in length kelps the red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the green algae see charales in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the point where these non algal plants begin and algae stop is usually
taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other alga groups algae and symbioses some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells
the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the alga examples include lichens a fungus is the host usually with a green alga or a cyanobacterium as its symbiont both fungal and algal species found in lichens are capable of living independently although habitat requirements may be greatly different from those of the lichen pair corals algae known as zooxanthellae are symbionts with corals notable amongst these is the dinoflagellate symbiodinium found in many hard corals the loss of symbiodinium
or other zooxanthellae from the host is known as coral bleaching sponges uses of algae algae are used by man in a great many ways
because many species are aquatic and microscopic they are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds algae culture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places energy source algae can be used to produce biodiesel see algae culture and by some estimates can produce vastly superior amounts of oil compared to terrestrial crops grown for the same purpose because algae grown to produce biodiesel does not need to meet the requirements of a food crop it is much cheaper
to produce also it does not need fresh water or fertilizer both of which are quite expensive algae can be grown to produce hydrogen in one nine three nine a german researcher named hans gaffron while working at the university of chicago observed that the algae he was studying chlamydomonas reinhardtii a green algae would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen gaffron never discovered the cause for this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts at its discovery in the late one nine nine zero s professor anastasios melis a
researcher at the university of california at berkeley discovered that if you
deprive the algae of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen normal photosynthesis to the production of hydrogen he found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase but that the hydrogenase will not cause this switch in the pressence of oxygen melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react causing the
algae to produce hydrogen chlamydomonas moeweesi is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen algae can be grown

of variance were pioneered by the statistician and geneticist ronald fisher in the one
nine two zero s and one nine three zero s and is sometimes known as fisher s anova or fisher s analysis of variance overview there are three conceptual classes of such models fixed effects model assumes that the data come from normal populations which differ in their means random effects models assume that the data describe a hierarchy of different populations whose differences are constrained by the hierarchy
mixed models describe situations where both fixed and random effects are present the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares into components related to the effects in the model used for example we show the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels if the treatment levels are quantitative and the effects are linear a linear regression analysis may be appropriate ss ss
ss the number of degrees of freedom abbreviated df can be partitioned in a similar way and specifies the chi square distribution which describes the associated sums of squares df df df fixed effects model the fixed effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter has subjected his experimental material to several treatments each of which affects only the mean of the underlying normal distribution of the response variable random effects model
random effects models are used to describe situations in which incomparable differences in experimental material occur the simplest example is that of estimating the unknown mean of a population whose individuals differ from each other in this case the variation between individuals is confounded with that of the observing instrument degrees of freedom degrees of freedom indicates the effective number of observations which contribute to the sum
of squares in an anova the total number of observations minus the number of linear constraints in the data tests of significance analyses of variance lead to tests of statistical significance using fisher s f distribution see also ancova manova important publications

in which the molecule has the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms and so has
no double bonds alkanes are aliphatic compounds the general formula for alkanes is cnh two n two the simplest possible alkane is therefore methane ch four the
next simplest is ethane c two h six the series continues indefinitely each carbon atom in an alkane has
sp hybridization alkanes are also known as paraffins or collectively as the paraffin series these terms also used for alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single unbranched chain such branched chain alkanes are called isoparaffins isomerism the atoms in alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in multiple ways forming different isomers normal alkanes have a linear unbranched configuration the number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for alkanes with one to one two carbon atoms
the number of isomers equals one one one two three five nine one eight three five seven five one five nine and three five five respectively nomenclature of alkanes the names of all alkanes end with ane alkanes with unbranched carbon chains the first four members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows methane ch four ethane c two h six propane c three h eight butane c four h one zero alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate
numerical multiplier with elision of a terminal a from the basic numerical term hence pentane c five h one two hexane c six h one four heptane c seven h one
six octane c eight h one eight etc for a more complete list see list of alkanes straight chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n for normal to distinguish them from branched chain alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight chain and branched chain isomers e g n hexane is a neurotoxin while its branched chain isomers are not alkanes with branched carbon chains branched alkanes are named
as follows identify the longest straight chain of carbon atoms number the atoms in this chain starting from one at one end and counting upwards to the other end examine the
groups attached to the chain in order and form their names form the name by looking at the different attached groups and writing for each group the following the number or numbers of the carbon atom or atoms where it is attached the prefixes di tri tetra etc if the group is attached in two three four etc places or nothing if it is attached in
only one place the name of the attached group the formation of the name is finished by writing down the name of the longest straight chain to carry out this algorithm we must know how to name the substituent groups this is done by the same method except that instead of the longest chain of carbon atoms the longest chain starting from the attachment point is used also the numbering is done so that the carbon atom next to the attachment point has the number one for example the compound is the only four carbon alkane possible apart from butane
its formal name is two methylpropane pentane however has two branched isomers in addition to its linear normal form two two dimethylpropane and two methylbutane trivial names the following nonsystematic names are retained in the iupac system isobutane for two methylpropane isopentane for two methylbutane neopentane for two two dimethylpropane the name isooctane is very widely used in the petrochemical industry
to refer to two two four trimethylpentane occurrence methane and ethane make up a large proportion of jupiter s atmosphere alkanes occur both on earth and in the solar system however only the first hundred or so and even then mostly only in traces
the light hydrocarbons especially methane and ethane for example have been detected both in the tail of the
comet hyakutake and in some meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites they also form an important portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune on titan the satellite of saturn it is believed that there were once large oceans
of these and longer chain alkanes smaller seas of liquid ethane are thought still to exist there traces of methane about zero zero zero zero one or one ppm occur in the earth s atmosphere produced primarily by forms of archaea the content in the oceans is negligible due to the low solubility in water however at high pressures and low temperatures methane can co crystallize with water to
form a solid methane hydrate although they cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the calorific value of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore
a candidate for future fuels extraction of alkanes in ontario today the most important commercial sources for alkanes are clearly natural gas and oil which are the only organic compounds to occur as minerals in nature natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons both were formed when dead marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment ie lacking in oxygen and converted over many millions of years at high
temperatures and high pressure to their current form natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction c six h one two o six three ch four three co two these hydrocarbons collected in porous rocks trapped beneath an impermeable cap rock in contrast to methane which is constantly reformed in large quantities higher alkanes rarely develop to a considerable extent in nature the present deposits will not be reformed once they are exhausted solid alkanes occur as evaporation residues from oil known as tar one of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in
the asphalt lake known as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago purification and use an oil refinery at martinez california alkanes are both
important raw materials of the chemical industry and the most important fuels of the
world economy the starting materials for the processing are always natural gas and crude oil the latter is separated
in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products for example gasoline the different fractions of crude oil have different boiling points and can be isolated and separated quite easily within the individual fractions the boiling points lie closely together the domain of usage of a certain alkane can be determined quite well
according to the number of carbon atoms although the following demarcation is idealized and not perfect the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation methane and ethane are the main componants of natural gas they are normally
stored as gases under pressure it is however easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are well known as liquified petroleum gas lpg propane for example is used in the propane gas burner butane in disposable cigarette lighters where the pressure is a mere two
bar the two alkanes are used as propellants in aerosol sprays from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the unifomity of the combustion branched chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straight chain homologues this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of
the fuel where two two four trimethylpentane isooctane has an arbitrary value of one zero zero and heptane has a value of zero apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable
for use in gasoline they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel diesel fuels are charaterised by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel
becomes too thick to flow correctly alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil in latter function they work at the same time as anti corrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters alkanes with a chain length of approximately three five or more carbon
atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking preparation numerous ways exist to prepare alkanes in the laboratory
the most well known methods are hydrogenation of alkenes and hydrolysis of grignard reagents alkanes can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the corey house posner whitesides reaction the barton mccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from
alcohols and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes molecular geometry sp three hybridisation in methane the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons the carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp three hybridised that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the two s orbital and the three two p orbitals these orbitals which have identical energies are arranged
spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of one zero nine four seven between them bond lengths and bond angles an alkane molecule has only c h and c c single bonds the former result from the overlap of a sp orbital of carbon with the one s orbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp orbitals on different carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to one zero nine one
zero one zero m for a c h bond and one five four one zero one zero m for a c c bond the tetrahedral structure of methane the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals they are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of one zero nine four seven between them structural formulae which represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with
the reality conformation the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry
of a molecule there is a further degree of freedom for each carbon carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond the spatial
arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation ethane ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there
is only one c c bond if one looks down the axis of the c c bond then one will see the so
called newman projection the circle represents the two carbon atoms one behind the other and the bonds to hydrogen are represented by the straight lines the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have
an angle of one two zero between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane however the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon
and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between zero and three six zero this is a
consequence of the free rotation about a carbon carbon single
bond despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important newman projections of the two conformations of ethane eclipsed on the left staggered on the right in the eclipsed conformation corresponding to a torsion angle of zero one two zero or two four zero the
hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are directly in front of those attached to the rear carbon in the staggered conformation corresponding to a torsion angle of six zero one eight zero or three zero zero the hydrogen
atoms attached to the front carbon are exactly in between those attached to the rear carbon the two conformations also known as rotomers
differ in energy the staggered conformation is one two six kj mol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the explanation for this difference in energy has been the
subject of debate with two main theories predominating in the eclipsed conformation the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the carbon hydrogen bonds is maximised in the staggered conformation the
hyperconjugation a form of delocalisation of the valence electrons is maximised these two explanations are not contradictory or exclusive the latter is thought
to be the more important for ethane itself this difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature there is constant rotation about the c c bond albeit with short pauses at each staggered conformation the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent
to the rotation of one ch three group by one two zero relative to the other is of the order of one zero one one seconds higher alkanes the four conformations of butane from left to right fully eclipsed inclined partially eclipsed antiperiplanar the situation with respect to the two c c bonds in propane is qualitatively similar to that of ethane it is more complex however for butane and higher alkanes if one takes the central c c
bond of butane as the reference axis each of the two central carbon atoms is bound to two hydrogen atoms and a methyl group four different conformations can be defined
by the torsion angle between the two methyl groups and as in the case of ethane each has its characteristic energy the fully eclipsed or synperiplanar conformation has a torsion angle of
zero it is the configuration with the highest energy the inclined conformation has a torsion angle of six zero or three zero zero it is a local energy minimum the partially eclipsed conformation has a torsion angle of one two zero or two four zero it is a local energy maximum the antiperiplanar conformation has a torsion angle of one eight zero the two methyl groups are as far from each other as is possible and this configuration has the lowest energy the
difference in energy between the fully eclipsed conformation and the antiperiplanar conformation is about one nine kj mol and is therefore still relatively small at ambient temperature the case of higher alkanes is similar the antiperiplanar conformation is always the most favoured
around each carbon carbon bond for this reason alkanes are usually shown
in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealised forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest the conformations of other organic molecules are based on
those of alkanes and are discussed in the relevant articles properties physical properties melting blue and boiling pink points of the first one four n alkanes in c the molecular structure particularly the surface area of the molecule determines the boiling point of the alkane the smaller the surface the lower the boiling point as the van der waals forces between the molecules are weaker a
reduction of the surface area can be achieved by chain branching or by a circular structure this means in practice that alkanes with higher number of carbon atoms usually have higher boiling points than those with lower numbers of carbon atoms and that branched chain alkanes and cycloalkanes have lower boiling points than their straight chain homologues under standard conditions from ch four to c four h one zero alkanes are gaseous from c five h one two to c one seven h three six they are liquids and after c one eight h three eight they are solids the
boiling point increases between two zero and three zero c per ch two group the melting points of the alkanes also rise with the increase in the number of carbon atoms with only one exception propane however the melting points rise more slowly than the boiling points in
particular for the higher alkanes in addition the melting points of alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms increase faster than the melting points of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms see figure the cause of this phenomenon is the higher packing density of the alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms the melting points of branched chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight chain alkanes depending on the efficiency of molecular packing this is particularly
true for isoalkanes two methyl isomers which often have melting points higher than those of their normal analogues alkanes do not conduct electricity
nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistance of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction
in entropy as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimised by minimising the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water
their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good a property which is called lipophilicity different alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves the density of
the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane water mixture chemical properties alkanes generally show a relatively low reactivity because their c h and c c bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily
broken unlike all other organic compounds they possess no functional groups they react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances the p k a values of all alkanes are above six zero and so they are practically inert to acids and bases this inertness is the source of the term paraffins latin para affinis with the meaning here of lacking affinity in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years however redox reactions
of alkanes in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition in the case of methane the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon four is reached reaction with oxygen leads to combustion with halogens substitution in addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where long chain alkanes are converted into shorter chain alkanes and straight chain
alkanes into branched chain isomers in highly brached alkanes the bond angles may differ significantly from the optimal value one zero nine five in order to allow the different groups sufficient space this causes a tension in the molecule known as steric hinderance and can substantially increase the reactivity thermochemistry alkanes are stable molecules relative to their constituent elements which is manifested as
a negative heat of formation for linear alkanes each methylene ch two unit contributes five kcal mol to the overal heat of formation branched alkanes are always a little bit more stable than their linear isomers for example two methylbutane is
more stable than n pentane by one eight kcal mol and two two methylpropane is more stable than n
pentane by five kcal mol see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data spectroscopic properties virtually all organic compounds contain carbon carbon and carbon hydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characreistic spectroscopic features infrared spectroscopy the carbon
hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between two eight five zero and two nine
six zero cm one while the carbon carbon stretching mode absorbes between eight zero zero and one three zero zero cm one the carbon hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at one four five zero cm one and one three seven five cm one while methylene groups show bands at one four six five cm one and one four five zero cm one carbon chains with
more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around seven two five cm one nmr spectroscopy the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at h zero one the carbon one three resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon c eight three zero methyl one five five five methylene two zero six zero methyne the carbon one three resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack
of nuclear overhauser enhancement and the long relaxation time it can be missed in routine spectra mass spectrometry alkanes have a high ionisation energy and
the molecular ion is usually weak the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group m one five is often absent and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of ch two groups reactions reactions with oxygen all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasing
difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases the general equation for complete combustion is two c n h two n two three n one o two two n one h two o two n co two in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below for methane two ch four three o two two co four h two o ch four o two c two h two o alkanes usually burn with a non luminous flame with very little soot
formation the standard enthalpy change of combustion c h o for alkanes increases by about six five zero kj mol per ch two group branched chain alkanes
have lower values of c h o than straight chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable reactions with halogens alkanes react with halogens in a so called halogenation reaction the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced or substituted by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species which participate in the reaction which usually leads
to a mixture of products the reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion
the chain mechanism is as follows using the chlorination of methane as a typical example one initiation splitting of a chlorine molecule to form two chlorine atoms initiated by ultraviolet radiation a chlorine atom has an unpaired electron and acts as a free radical cl two two cl two propagation two steps a hydrogen atom is pulled off from methane then the methyl radical pulls a cl from cl two
ch four cl ch three hcl ch three cl two ch three cl cl this results in the desired product plus another chlorine radical this radical will then go on to take part in another propagation reaction causing a chain reaction if there is sufficient chlorine other products such as ch two cl two may be formed three termination recombination of two free
radicals cl cl cl two or ch three cl ch three cl or ch three ch three c two h six the last possibility in the termination step will result in an impurity in the final mixture notably this results in an organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants in the case of methane or ethane all the hydrogen atoms are equivalent and have an equal chance of being replaced this leads to what is known as a statistical product distribution for propane and higher alkanes the hydrogen atoms which form part of ch
two or ch groups are preferentially replaced the reactivity of the different halogens varies considerably the relative rates are fluorine one zero eight chlorine one bromine seven one
zero one one iodine two one zero two two hence the reaction of alkanes with fluorine is difficult to control that with chlorine is moderate to fast that with bromine is slow and requires high levels of uv irradiation while the reaction with iodine is practically non existent and thermodynamically unfavorable these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons cracking and reforming cracking
breaks larger molecules into smaller ones this can be done
with a thermic or catalytic method the thermal cracking process follows
a homolytic mechanism that is bonds break symmetrically and thus pairs of free radicals are formed the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as silica alumina and zeolites which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion carbon localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement c c scission in position beta i e cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride
transfer in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a self propagating chain mechanism the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination here is an example of cracking with butane ch three ch two ch two ch three one st possibility four eight breaking is done
on the ch three ch two bond ch three ch two ch two ch three after a certain number of steps we will obtain an alkane

after a certain number of steps we will obtain an alkene and hydrogen gas ch two ch ch two ch three h two other reactions alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen alkanes can by chlorosulfonated and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions the fermentation of
alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides hazards methane is explosive in when mixed with air one eight ch four and is a strong greenhouse gas other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air the lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable although this risk decreases with the length of the
carbon chain pentane hexane heptane and octane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful the straight chain isomer of hexane is a neurotoxin and therefore rarely used commercially alkanes in nature although
alkanes occur in nature in various way they do not rank biologically among the essential materials cycloalkanes with one four to one eight carbon atoms occur in musk extracted from deer of the family moschidae all further information refers to acyclic alkanes bacteria and archaea methanogenic archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in the
earth s atmosphere certain types of bacteria can metabolise alkanes they prefer even numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd numbered chains on the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantites of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidised organic compounds the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen co two four
h two ch four two h two o methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them the methane output of cattle and other herbivores
which can release up to one five zero litres per day and of termites is also due to methanogens they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in
a similar way fungi and plants water forms droplets on a thin film of alkane wax on the skin of the apple alkanes also play a role if a minor role in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi plants and animals some specialised yeasts e g candida tropicale pichia sp rhodotorula sp can use alkanes as a source of carbon and or energy the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer chain alkanes in aviation
fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions in plants it is the solid long chain alkanes that are found they form a
firm layer of wax the cuticle over areas of the plant exposed to the air this protects the plant against water loss while preventing the leaching of important minerals by the rain it is also a protection against bacteria fungi and harmful insects the latter sink with
their legs into the soft waxlike substance and have difficulty moving the shining layer on fruits such as apples consists of long chain alkanes the carbon chains are usually between twenty
and thirty carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants from fatty acids the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity animals alkanes are found in animal products although they are less
important than unsaturated hydrocarbons on example is the shark liver oil which is approximately one four pristane

ophrys sphegodes the latter is dependent for pollination on the former sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate in the case of a nigroaenea the females emit a mixture
of tricosane c two three h four eight pentacosane c two five h five two and heptacosane c two seven h five six in the ratio three three one and males are attracted by specifically this odour the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance
of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees as a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempte to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavour is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms see also

a lower court indicating one s intention to take the matter to the next higher court with jurisdiction over the matter and then actually filing the appeal with the appropriate appellate court united states the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal
on the record a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by administrative agency referees masters commissioners and some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record in such a proceeding all issues and evidence may be
developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the
just result precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding
evidence improperly acting outside the court s jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of
the lower court s judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower court s view of the
evidence and reverses its decision only if it was a clear abuse of discretion this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court s decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard in some rare cases
an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered in the case of new evidence there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial another issue suitable for appeal
in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to a new trial an appellate court is a court that hears cases in which a lower court either a trial court or a lower level appellate court has already
made a decision but in which at least one party to the action wants to challenge this ruling based upon some legal grounds that are allowed to be appealed either by right or by leave of the appellate court these grounds typically include errors of law fact or due process in different jurisdictions appellate courts are also called appeals courts courts of appeals superior courts or supreme courts
who can appeal a party who files an appeal is called an appellant and a party on the other side is an appellee or respondent or in some jurisdictions the party who files is known as a petitioner and the party being sued is designated the respondent cross appeals can also occur when more than one party to a case is unhappy with the decision in some way often when the winning party claims that more damages were deserved than were awarded an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or
legal principle the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to move for leave to appeal in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant s demand to appeal the lower court s decision in tort equity or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal in criminal matters however the state or
prosecution generally has no appeal as of right and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from a trial court s dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court s granting of a defendant s suppression motion likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may
appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court and or the appellate court how an appeal is processed generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not the appellate court will typically be
deferential to the lower court s findings of fact such as whether a defendant committed a particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the court s application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below i e in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it
may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect in some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower court s findings of fact this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by
granting a pre trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony another situation is where appeal is by way of re hearing certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court an example would be an appeal from a magistrate s court to the crown court in england and wales sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties
used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate court s rules to file the appeal in england and many other jurisdictions however the phrase appeal dismissed is equivalent to the u s term affirmed and the phrase appeal allowed is equivalent to the u s term reversed generally there is no trial in an appellate
court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed unless the appeal is by way of re hearing new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that
was before that court and is relevant to the appeal in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court in those cases the record will
first be certified by the lower court the appellant has the opportunity
to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the
submitted briefs it is important to note that in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand even if it might have been overturned on appeal in the united states a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court see also list of legal topics appellate review

is the first pleading by a defendant usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict
time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant it may have been preceded by an optional pre answer motion to dismiss or demurrer if such a motion is unsuccessful the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment the answer establishes which allegations cause of action in civil matters set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant and states all the defendant s defenses thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy
to be decided by the court in the case of a criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other
kind of appearance before the court by the defendant the pleading in the criminal case which is entered on the record in open court is either guilty

to arraignment the accused is expected to enter a plea acceptable pleas vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but they generally include guilty not guilty and the peremptory pleas or pleas in bar which set out reasons why
a trial cannot proceed in addition us jurisdictions allow pleas of nolo contendere no contest and the alford plea in some circumstances in the uk arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment the defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each individual charge guilty and not
guilty pleas if the defendant pleads guilty an evidentiary hearing usually follows the court is not required to accept a
guilty plea during that hearing the judge will assess the offense mitigating factors and the defendant s character and then pass sentence if the defendant pleads not guilty a
date will be set for a preliminary hearing or trial what if the defendant enters no plea in the past a defendant who refused to plea or stood mute would be subjected to peine forte et dure law french for strong and hard punishment but today in all common law jurisdictions

often found in christian hymnals in a wide variety of churches in the united states and may be sung as part of a christian service of worship to god history the words are by katharine lee bates
an english teacher at wellesley college she had taken a train trip to colorado springs colorado in one eight nine three to teach a short summer school session at colorado college and several of the sights on her trip found their way into her poem the world s columbian exposition in chicago illinois the
white city with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings the wheat fields of kansas through which her train was riding on july four the majestic view of the great plains from atop pike s peak on that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel the
poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate the fourth of july it quickly caught the public s fancy amended versions were published in one nine zero four and one nine one three several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem the hymn materna composed in one eight eight two by samuel a ward was generally considered the best music as early as one nine one zero and is still the popular tune today ward had been similarly inspired the tune came to
him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney
island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down ward died in one nine zero three not knowing the national stature his music would attain miss bates was more fortunate as the song s popularity was well established by her death in one nine two nine at various times in the more than one zero zero years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born particularly during the john f
kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of the star
spangled banner but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying
it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the star spangled banner some prefer america the beautiful over the star spangled banner due to the latter s war oriented imagery others prefer the star spangled banner for the same reason while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the
tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans popularity of the song soared following the september one one two zero zero one attacks at some
sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem ray charles is credited with the song s most well known rendition in current times although elvis presley had a good success with it in the seven zero s his recording is very commonly played at major sporting events such as the super bowl his unique take on it places the third verse first after which he sings the usual first verse in the third

a tdd telephone device for the deaf and in the usa generally called a ttyteletypewriter which converts typed characters into tones that may be sent over the telephone line the deaf person is able to communicate immediately at a distance together with relay services where an operator reads what the deaf person types
and types what a hearing person says the deaf person is then given access to everyone s telephone not just those of people who possess text telephones many telephones now have volume controls which are primarily intended for the benefit of people who are hard of hearing but can be useful for all users at times and places where there is significant background noise another

people such as fall detectors thermometers for hypothermia risk flooding and unlit gas sensors for people with mild dementia the principle being that these alerts can be customised to the particular person s risks when the alert
is triggered a message is sent to a carer or contact centre who can respond appropriately the
range of sensors is wide and expanding rapidly technology similar to telecare can also be used to act within a person

above unlit gas sensors for people with dementia can be used to trigger a device that turns off the gas and tells someone what has happened this is safer than just telling an external person that there is a problem designing for people with dementia is a good example of where the design of the interface of a piece of assistive technology at is critical to its usefulness it is
important to make sure that people with dementia or any other identified
user group are involved in the design process to make sure
that the design is accessible and useable in the example above a voice message could be used to remind the person with dementia to turn of the gas himself but who s voice should be used and what should the message say questions like these must be answered through user consultantion involvement and evaluation assistive technology products standing frames support wheelchair users

the abacus are disputed suggestions including invention in babylonia and in china to have taken place between two four zero zero bc and three zero zero bc the first abacus was almost certainly based on a flat stone covered with
sand or dust lines were drawn in the sand and pebbles used to aid calculations from this a variety of abaci were developed the most popular were based on the
bi quinary system using a combination of two bases base two and base five to represent decimal numbers the use of the word abacus dates back to before one three eight seven when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe a sandboard abacus the latin word came from abakos the greek genitive form of abax calculating table because abax also had the sense of table sprinkled with sand or dust used for drawing geometric figures it is speculated
by some linguists that the greek word may be derived from a semitic root b q the hebrew word for dust though details of the transmission are obscure it may also be derived from the phoenician word abak meaning sand the plural of abacus is abaci babylonian abacus a tablet found on the island of salamis near greece in one eight four
six dates back to the babylonians of three zero zero bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it was originally thought to be a gaming board its construction is a slab of white marble measuring one four nine cm in length seven
five cm in width and four five cm thick on which are five groups of markings in the center of the tablet are a set of five parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semi circle at the intersection
of the bottom most horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semi circle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line roman abacus reconstruction of roman abacus the late empire roman abacus shown here in reconstruction contains eight long and eight shorter grooves
the former having up to five beads in each and the latter one the groove marked i indicates units x tens and so on up to millions the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives five units five tens etc essentially in a bi quinary coded decimal system obviously related to the roman numerals the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces computations are made by means of beads which would probably have been slid up and down the grooves to indicate the value of each column chinese abacus the
suanpan of the chinese is similar to the roman abacus in principle though has a different construction and it was designed to do both decimal and hexadecimal arithmetics chinese abacus the suanpan the chinese abacus is typically
around two zero cm eight inches tall and it comes in various widths depending on the application it usually has more than seven rods there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal
computation the beads are usually rounded and made of a hard wood the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam the abacus can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads
away from the horizontal beam at the center chinese abaci can be used for functions other than counting unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cube root operations at high speed bead arithmetic is the calculating technique used with various types of abaci in particular the chinese
abacus japanese abacus soroban the japanese eliminated first one bead from the upper deck and later another bead from the lower deck in each column of the chinese abacus the japanese also eliminated the use of qiuchu chinese division table the method of chinese division table was still used when there were five lower beads there came the war of the multiplication table versus the division table the school of multiplication table prevailed in one nine two zero s
the rods number of digits increase to usually two one two three two seven or even three one thus allowing calculation for more digits soroban is taught in elementary schools as a part of lessons
in mathematics when teaching the soroban a song like instruction is given by the tutor the soroban is about eight cm three inches tall the beads on a soroban are
usually shaped as a double cone bi cone to facilitate ease of movement often primary students may bring along with them two sorobans one with one upper bead and five lower beads the other with one upper bead with four lower beads when they learn soroban
in school the size of beads of soroban is standardized and they come in two types the japanese classified soroban for native japanese and a separate
size for foreigners since westerners tend to be larger than most japanese and therefore have larger hands and fingers the soroban that are
for foreigners are made with a plastic pipe on both the left and right side of the frame while ones made for native japanese were all made with wooden frames in this way the thickness of the soroban for foreigners is higher rendering it easier for the non japanese to manipulate japanese soroban russian abacus russian
abacus the russian abacus the schoty or sjotty usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire which has four and acts as a separator or for fractions this wire is
usually near the user the russian abacus is often used vertically with wires from left to right in the manner of a book the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center in order to keep
the beads pinned to either of the two sides it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right during manipulation beads are moved to the left for easy viewing the middle two beads on each wire the five th and six th bead usually have a colour different to the other eight beads likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color the russian
abacus is still in common use today in shops and markets throughout the former soviet union although it is no longer taught in most schools school abacus school abacus used in danish elementary school early two zero th century around the world abaci have been used in pre schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching arithmetics in western countries a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires has been common see image it is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy uses by the visually impaired abaci are still commonly used
by individuals who have visual impairments they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cubic root a
piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they don t move inadvertently this keeps the beads in place while the user feels or manipulates them recently abaci have been replaced to some extent by electronic calculators with speech but only in those countries where they are easily available and affordable however even when
they are available many visually impaired people still prefer to use the abacus in addition many blind children are required to learn how to use the abacus before they are permitted the use of a talking calculator or similar device this can be compared to sighted children being required to learn how to solve mathematical problems on paper before they are allowed the use of a calculator native american abacus some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient mayan culture this mesoamerican abacus

are three common ways to define an acid namely the arrhenius the br nsted lowry and the lewis definitions in order of increasing generality arrhenius according
to this definition an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ion h three o when dissolved in water while bases are substances that increase the concentration of hydroxide ions oh this definition limits
acids and bases to substances that can dissolve in water around one eight zero zero many french chemists including antoine lavoisier incorrectly believed that all acids contained oxygen english chemists including sir humphry davy at the same time believed all acids contained hydrogen the swedish chemist svante arrhenius used this belief to develop this definition of acid br nsted lowry according to this definition an acid
is a proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor the acid is said to be dissociated after the proton
is donated an acid and the corresponding base are referred to conjugate acid base pairs br nsted and lowry formulated this definition which includes water insoluble substances not in the arrhenius definition lewis according to this definition an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base is an electron pair donor these are frequently referred to as lewis acids and lewis bases and are electrophiles and nucleophiles in organic chemistry lewis acids include substances with no protons such as iron iii chloride the lewis definition can also be explained with molecular orbital theory
in general an acid can receive an electron pair in its lowest unoccupied orbital lumo from the highest occupied orbital homo of a base that is the homo from the base and the lumo from the acid combine to a bonding molecular orbital this definition was developed by gilbert n lewis although not the most general theory the br nsted lowry definition is the most widely used definition the strength of an acid may be understood by this defintion by
the stability of hydronium and the solvated conjugate base upon dissociation increasing stability of the the conjugate base will increase the acidity of a compound this concept of acidity is used frequently for organic acids such as carboxylic acid the molecular orbital description where the unfilled proton orbital overlaps with a lone pair is connected to the lewis definition solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions acid base systems are different from redox reactions in that
there is no change in oxidation state generally acids have the following chemical and physical properties taste acids generally are sour when dissolved in water touch acids produce a stinging feeling particularly strong acids reactivity acids react aggressively with or corrode most metals electrical conductivity acids are electrolytes strong acids are dangerous causing severe burns for even minor contact generally acid burns are treated by rinsing the affected area abundantly with water
and followed up with immediate medical attention nomenclature acids are named according to the ending of their anion that ionic ending is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table below for example hcl
has chloride as its anion so the ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid chemical characteristics in water the following equilibrium occurs between an acid ha and water which acts as a base ha aq h three o aq a aq the acidity constant or acid dissociation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of ha with water k a three mbox cdota over ha strong acids have large k a values i e the reaction equilibrium lies far to the right the acid is almost
completely dissociated to h three o and a strong acids include the heavier hydrohalic acids hydrochloric acid hcl hydrobromic acid hbr and hydroiodic acid hi however hydrofluoric acid hf is relatively weak for example the k a value for hydrochloric acid hcl is one zero seven weak acids have small k a values i e at equilibrium significant amounts of ha and
a exist together in solution modest levels of h three o are present the acid is only partially dissociated for example the ka value for acetic acid is one eight x one zero five most organic acids are weak acids oxoacids which tend
to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen may be quite strong or weak nitric acid sulfuric acid and perchloric acid are all strong acids whereas nitrous acid sulfurous acid and hypochlorous acid are all weak note the following the terms hydrogen ion and proton are used interchangebly both refer to h in aqueous solution the water is protonated to form hydronium ion h three o aq this is often abbreviated as h aq even though the symbol is not chemically correct
the strength of an acid is measured by its acid dissociation constant k a or equivalently its p k a p k a log k a the ph of a solution is a measurement of the concentration of hydronium this will depend of the concnetration and nature of acids and bases in solution polyprotic acids polyprotic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of
polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid two potenital protons to donate and triprotic acid
three potenital protons to donate a monoprotic acid can undergo one dissociation sometimes called ionization as follows and simply has one acid dissociation constant as shown above ha aq h two o l h three o aq a aq k a a diprotic acid here symbolized by h two a can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka one and ka two h two a aq h two o l h three o

similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid h two co three can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion hco three and lose a second to form carbonate anion co three two both k a values are small but k a one k a two a triprotic acid h three a can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where k a one k a two k a three h three a

organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate

the structure of asphalt however it is most commonly modeled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the
dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase asphalt is sometimes confused with tar which is an artificial material produced by the destructive distillation of organic matter tar is also predominantly composed of bitumen however the bitumen content of tar is typically lower than that of asphalt tar and asphalt have very different engineering properties asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel by the process of fractional distillation usually under vacuum conditions a better
separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a de asphalting unit which uses either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen this makes the product harder and more viscous natural deposits of asphalt include lake asphalts primarily from the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and bermudez lake in venezuela gilsonite the dead sea in israel and tar sands asphalt is rather
hard to transport in bulk it hardens unless kept very hot so it is sometimes mixed with diesel oil or kerosene before shipping upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or bfs the largest use of asphalt
is for making asphalt concrete for pavements which accounts for approximately eight zero of the asphalt consumed in
the united states roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption other uses include
cattle sprays fence post treatments and waterproofing for fabrics in the ancient middle east natural asphalt deposits were used for mortar between bricks and stones ship caulk and waterproofing the persian word for asphalt is mumiya which may be the source for the english word mummy references barth edwin j asphalt science and technology gordon and breach one nine six two isbn zero six seven seven zero zero zero four zero five external links black stuff hawaii asphalt pavement guide petroleum products construction

descent these alarms tore the crew s attention away from the scene outside as the descent proceeded in nasa s mission control center in houston texas a young controller named steve bales told the flight director that it was safe to continue the descent in spite of the alarms once they returned their attention to the view outside the astronauts saw that their computer was guiding them toward a landing site full of large rocks scattered around a large

scan television system and were picked up at goldstone in the usa but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek in australia
minutes later the tv was switched to normal television and the feed was switched to the more sensitive radio telescope station at the parkes observatory in australia despite some technical
and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and were immediately broadcast to at least six zero zero million people on earth after describing the surface very fine grained almost like a powder armstrong stepped off eagle s footpad and into history as the first human to set foot on another world he reported that moving
in the moon s gravity one sixth of earth s was perhaps even easier than the simulations in addition to fulfilling president john f kennedy s mandate to land a man on the moon before the end of the one nine six zero s apollo one one was
an engineering test of the apollo system therefore armstrong snapped photos of the lm so engineers would be able to judge its post landing condition he then collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick he folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh he removed the tv camera from the mesa made a panoramic sweep and mounted it on a tripod one two m four zero ft
from the lm the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva photo of the actual plaque left on the moon attached
to the ladder of the lm descent stage aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including two footed kangaroo hops the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backwards but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit though the helmet was warmer in
sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow a visible shockwave formed as the saturn v encountered maximum dynamic pressure max q at about one minute
two zero seconds into the flight altitude one two five km four km downrange velocity four four zero m s together the astronauts planted the u s flag then took a phone call from president richard nixon the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits the integrated thermal meteoroid garment they deployed the easep which included a passive seismograph and a laser ranging retroreflector
then armstrong loped about one two zero m four zero zero ft from the lm to snap photos at the rim of east crater while aldrin collected two core tubes he used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes the only time the hammer was used on apollo
one one the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documented sample collection halfway through the allotted three four min neil armstrong works at the lm in one of the few photos taken of him from the lunar surface nasa photo as one one four zero five eight eight six during this period mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong
that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as
time ran out rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk however so mission control granted the astronauts a one five minute extension lunar ascent and return aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than two two kg four eight lb of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor armstrong then jumped to the
ladder s third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the
explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes one hasselblad camera and other equipment then they lifted off in
eagle s ascent stage to rejoin cmp michael collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit eagle was jettisoned and left in lunar orbit later nasa reports mentioned that eagle s orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface after more
than two hours on the lunar surface they returned to collins on board columbia bringing two zero eight seven kilograms of lunar samples with them the two moon walkers had left behind scientific instruments such as a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment they also left an american flag and other mementos including a plaque mounted on the lm descent stage ladder bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and richard nixon the inscription read here men from planet earthfirst set foot upon

fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace these brave men neil armstrong and edwin aldrin know that there is no hope for
their recovery but they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice these two men are laying down their lives in mankind s most noble goal the search for truth and understanding they will be mourned by
their families and friends they will be mourned by their nation they will be mourned by the people of the world they will be mourned by a mother earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown in their exploration they stirred the people of the world to feel as one in their sacrifice they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man in ancient days men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations in modern times we do much the same but

the signal was picked up by three purpose built stations goldstone california honeysuckle creek australia and fresnedillas spain and backed up by deep space network stations known as
wing stations in australia spain and the united states at first the signal was routed
to greenbelt maryland by way of submarine telephone cables using twelve voice circuits the signal was divided into twelve parts using inverse multiplexing sent onto the circuits and reintegrated in maryland before being sent on to nasa in houston intelsat satellites began taking over the trans oceanic transmissions toward the end of the one nine six zero s and nasa ended its contracts for the submarine telephone circuits which were then reallocated by telephone
administrations for normal voice use on one four july one nine six nine the intelsat satellite over the atlantic failed a replacement was launched on one six july but went into a useless orbit and would not be reoriented in time to be used the early bird satellite was activated but thought it might not have enough power to get a signal to the united states the australia station was vital to picking up the signal during the moonwalks or keeping the astronauts waiting on the moon eight hours before venturing out a communications team was dispatched
to spain to begin setting up the telephone circuits for nasa s inverse multiplexed signal european telecommunications administrators mostly government post offices were not accustomed to doing the business required they would normally require telegram messages to be exchanged with top level administrative approval but the twelve circuits had to be recovered from six countries to be made available to nasa which had set a time limit two hours before launch or the launch would be canceled it would be the last ideal launch
window before one nine seven zero other launch windows had been missed due to spacecraft equipment problems an official with the spanish communications authority
helped the team secure the circuits with his own personal list of contacts the last circuit using inverse multiplexing was accepted by nasa just minutes before the time limit three days later the transmissions from the moon were picked up in spain relayed to the united states over the undersea circuits and made available by nasa to the americas they were beamed across the pacific ocean and from the far east were carried on the indian ocean satellite the postal telephone authority in west germany turned a large radio dish to
aim at the indian ocean satellite picking up the signal from australia and providing it to western europe therefore viewers in western europe saw neil armstrong set foot on the moon a full half second later than those in the united states and some one eight seconds after it actually happened had this vital communications link not been restored the pledge of president john f kennedy to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade would have been
missed mission trivia and urban legends trivia some internal nasa planning documents referred to the callsigns of the csm and lm as snowcone and haystack these were quietly changed before being announced to the press shortly after landing before preparations have begun for
the eva aldrin broadcast that this is the lm pilot
i d like to take this opportunity to ask every person
listening in whoever and wherever they may be to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way he then took holy communion privately at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by madalyn murray o hair who had objected to the apollo eight crew reading from the book of genesis which demanded
that their astronauts refrain from religious activities while in space as such aldrin an episcopalian chose to refrain from directly mentioning this he had kept the plan quiet not even mentioning it to his wife and did not reveal it publicly for several years several books indicate that early mission timelines had buzz aldrin not neil armstrong
as the first man on the moon a replica of the footprint left by neil armstrong is located in tranquility park in houston texas the park was dedicated in one nine seven nine a decade after the first moon landing the australian movie the dish two zero zero zero tells the slightly fictionalised story of how the images of the moon walk were received by the radio telescope at parkes observatory new south wales according to the hbo mini series from the earth to the moon michael collins made the following suggestion as to
what armstrong should say upon stepping onto the lunar surface if you had any balls you d say oh my god what is that thing then scream and cut your mic armstrong claims to have said that s one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind although the a is not at all clear in recordings made at ground control it has been pointed out that the audio and video links
were somewhat intermittent partly due to storms near parkes observatory recently digital analysis of
the tape by nasa revealed the a may have been spoken but obscured by static folklore at some point while on the moon armstrong supposedly said good luck mr gorski some years later gorski died so he felt he could now explain this remark as a boy he heard a couple next door arguing and the wife said oral sex is it oral sex you want you ll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon mr
gorski this story is untrue neil armstrong apparently took a tartan where no tartan had been worn before a tiny swatch of the clan armstrong plaid was affixed to his suit when he walked on the moon another item that armstrong took with him was a special diamond studded astronaut pin which was
given to deke slayton by the widows of the apollo one crew the pin had been intended to be flown in apollo one then given to deke after the mission but due to the disaster the widows ended up giving the pin to him after the funerals deke gave the pin to
neil to leave at tranquility base two main conspiracy theories surround the mission firstly that the landing was a hoax this is generally discounted although it has slowly grown in popularity particularly since the release of the movie capricorn one one nine seven eight which portrays a nasa attempt to fake a landing on mars secondly a less well known urban legend suggests that they were being watched while on the moon and had seen alien vehicles there this grew in popularity after the book someone else is on our moon was published according to another
legend a survey undertaken in the one nine eight zero s in morocco revealed that a substantial percentage didn t think man had landed on the moon this was not due to conspiracy theory but rather to that segment not having been informed see

orbit around the moon it was also the first manned launch of the saturn v rocket nasa prepared for the mission in only four months the hardware involved had only been used a few times the saturn v had launched only twice before and the apollo spacecraft had only just finished its first manned mission apollo seven however the
success of the mission paved the way for the successful completion of john f kennedy s goal of landing on the moon before the end of the decade after launching on december two one one nine six eight the crew took three days to travel to the moon which they orbited for two zero hours while in lunar orbit they made a christmas eve television broadcast this was one of the most watched
broadcasts of all time planning on december two two one nine six six nasa announced the crew for the third manned apollo flight frank borman michael collins and bill anders collins was replaced by his backup jim lovell in july one nine six eight after collins had to have surgery as he was suffering cervical intervertebral disc herniation an intervertebral disc had slipped into the spinal cavity and required two vertebrae to be fused together collins recovered and went on
to be the command module pilot for apollo one one in september one nine six seven the manned spacecraft center in houston texas proposed a series of missions that would lead up to a manned lunar landing seven mission types were outlined each testing a specific set of components and tasks each previous step needed to be completed
successfully before the next mission type could be undertaken these were a unmanned command service module csm test b unmanned lunar module lm test c manned csm in low earth orbit d manned csm and lm in low earth orbit e manned csm and lm in an elliptical earth orbit with an apogee of four six zero zero mi seven four zero zero km f manned csm and lm in lunar orbit g manned lunar landing of all
the components of the apollo system the lunar module lm which would eventually be used to land on the moon presented the most problems it was behind schedule and when the first model was shipped to cape
canaveral in june one nine six eight over one zero one separate defects were discovered grumman aircraft engineering corporation which was the lead contractor for the lm predicted that the first mannable lm to be used for the d mission would not be ready until at least february one nine six nine delaying the entire sequence apollo csm diagram nasa george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august since the command service module
csm would be ready three months before the lunar module they could fly a csm only mission in december
one nine six eight but instead of just repeating the flight of apollo seven the c mission that would fly
the csm in earth orbit they could send the csm all the way to the moon and maybe even
enter into orbit this mission was dubbed the c prime mission this new mission would allow nasa to test procedures that would be used on the manned lunar landings that would otherwise have to wait until apollo one zero the f mission there were also concerns from the cia
that the soviets were planning their own circumlunar flight for december to upstage the americans once again see zond program the first stage of as five zero three being erected in the vab on february one one nine six eight almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission the only person
who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator however outvoted by the rest of the agency he gave his approval after leading the agency for eight years he would resign just four days before the launch of apollo seven the first manned apollo flight deke slayton the director of flight crew operations decided to swap the crews of the d and e missions
james mcdivitt the original commander of the d mission has said he was never offered the circumlunar flight but would probably have turned it down as he wanted to fly the lunar module borman on the other hand jumped at the chance his original mission would just have been a repeat of the previous flight except in a higher orbit this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft borman s crew would now use csm one zero three while mcdivitt s crew would use csm one zero four in the end the e mission was
canceled as most its objectives had been covered by the apollo eight and apollo nine flights mission managers were also confident that apollo one zero would also cover the remaining objectives with its lunar orbit flight on september nine the crew entered the simulators to begin their preparation for the flight by the time the mission
flew the crew would have spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight although all crew members were trained for all aspects of the mission it was necessary to specialize borman as commander was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the re entry lovell was trained on
navigating the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the earth anders was placed in charge of checking the spacecraft was in working order it was not until november one two that a public announcement was made about the change of mission for apollo eight previous to this thomas o paine the deputy administrator of nasa had made a fleeting remark that all options were being considered borman s main concern during the four months leading up to the launch was keeping the flight plan as simple as possible not accepting any addition that
went beyond the simple objectives of performing the first manned saturn v launch going to the moon and orbiting it he made sure that they stayed in lunar orbit only as long as necessary one zero orbits the crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance
from new york to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second the saturn v the apollo eight saturn v being rolled out to pad three nine a the saturn v rocket used by apollo eight was designated sa five zero three the third flight model when it was erected in the vertical assembly building on two zero december one nine six seven it was thought that the rocket would be used for an
unmanned test flight carrying a boilerplate command service module although apollo six had suffered several major problems it suffered severe pogo oscillation during its first stage and two second stage engines shutdown early marshall space flight center in charge of the saturn v was confident that it could solve all the issues without the need for another unmanned test flight the sa five zero three mission was thus changed to a manned one however nasa managers did impose some restrictions on a manned flight
taking place the s ii second stage had to undergo cryogenic testing at the mississippi test facility and other changes were to be made to man rate the vehicle so
on april three zero the saturn v was unstacked and the s ii second stage shipped by barge to the test site the spark igniters on the second and third stage engines were also modified in may one nine six eight a leak was found in a first stage engine requiring it to be replaced
with only two launches of the saturn v under its belt the ground crew
at kennedy space center ksc was having problems keeping to the schedule the grumman crew was also having issues with the lunar module concern was expressed at the fact so much work had to be done on the lunar module after it had shipped to the cape the ascent engine developed leaks that caused redesigns and valve changes then in august one nine six eight the entire mission changed sa five zero three would launch men to the moon and would not be carrying a
lunar module instead carrying a mass equivalent called a lunar module test article lta similar to ones used for apollo four and apollo six in order to speed up the pre launch preparations much of the modification of the saturn v was taken out of the hands of ksc and given to appropriate development centers only changes that affected crew safety were made the apollo eight spacecraft was placed on top of the
rocket on september two one and the rocket made the slow three mile five km journey
to the launch pad on nine october testing continued all through december until the day before launch the sa five zero three designation stood for saturn apollo and was used by nasa departments concerned with the launch vehicle however departments concerned with the manned flight often used as five zero three standing for apollo saturn both of these designations were used at the time to refer to the mission as a whole the five zero three number indicated that it was flight number three five zero three of the saturn v five
zero three the mission launch and trans lunar injection apollo eight launch the photo is a double exposure as the moon was not visible at the time of launch nasa apollo eight launched at seven five one zero zero a m eastern standard time on december two one one nine six eight the entire launch phase was practically flawless with only minor problems the s ic first stage s engines underperformed by zero seven five causing the engines to burn for two four five seconds longer than planned
towards the end of the second stage burn the rocket
underwent pogo oscillations that frank borman estimated were of the order of one two hz and about zero two five g two five m s the first manned saturn v placed the spacecraft into a one one two eight mi by one one eight nine mi one eight one five km by one nine one three km earth orbit with a period of eight eight minutes and one zero seconds the apogee was also slightly higher than intended with a planned circular orbit of one one five mi one eight
five km the s ic impacted the atlantic ocean at and the s ii at for the next two hours and three eight
minutes the crew and mission control worked to check that the spacecraft was in working in order and ready for trans lunar injection tli the burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon at the same time the crew transformed the capsule from a rocket payload to a spacecraft
and the s ivb third stage had to be in working order on
the previous unmanned test the s ivb had failed to re ignite during the
flight there would be three capsule communicators usually referred to as capcoms on a rotating roster these were the only people who would normally communicate with the crew michael collins was the first of these on duty and at two hours two seven minutes and two two seconds after launch radioed apollo
eight you are go for tli mission control had given official permission for the crew to go to the moon over the next twelve minutes before the burn the crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the rocket the s ivb third stage rocket ignited on time and burned perfectly for five minutes and one seven seconds the burn increased the velocity of the spacecraft to three five five zero five ft s one zero eight two two m s and their altitude at the end of the burn was two one five four mi three
four six seven km they were the fastest humans in history now that the s ivb had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage as well as practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft around they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it this
was the first time humans had been able to see the entire earth in one go borman became worried that the s ivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control at first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module to add three ft s zero nine m s away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of
the s ivb after much discussion it was decided to burn in this direction anyway but at nine ft s two seven m s these discussions ended up putting the crew an hour behind their flight plan five hours after launch mission control commanded the s ivb booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change its trajectory such that it would flyby the moon and enter into a solar orbit so as to pose no future hazard to the crew it went into a zero nine nine by zero nine two
au solar orbit with an inclination of two three four seven and a period of three four zero eight zero days the members of the apollo eight crew were the first humans to pass through the van
allen radiation belts which extend up to one five zero zero zero mi two five zero zero zero km from earth although it was predicted that the passage through the belts would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x ray or one milligray during the course of a year the average human receives a dose
of two to three mgy there was still interest in the radiation dosages on the crew so each crewmember wore a personal radiation dosimeter that could be read back to the ground as well as three passive film dosimeters that show the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the average radiation dose of the crew was one six mgy coasting to the moon one of the first images taken by humans of the
whole earth probably photographed by bill anders south is up with south america in the middle jim lovell s main job as command module pilot was to act as navigator although mission control performed all the actual navigation calculation it was necessary that in case of communication loss the crew could navigate their way home this was done by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star
and the earth s or the moon s horizon this proved to be difficult as the venting by the s ivb had caused a large cloud of debris to form around the spacecraft making it hard to distinguish what were the actual stars by seven hours into the mission the delay in moving away from the s ivb and lovell s star sightings meant that they were behind schedule on the flight plan by about one hour and four zero
minutes the crew now placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc or what is more aptly called barbecue mode this had the spacecraft roll about one rotation per hour along its long axis in order to ensure even heat distribution of the spacecraft in direct
sunlight the spacecraft could be heated to over two zero zero c while the parts in shadow would be one zero zero c these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack or propellant lines to burst as it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft actually swept out a cone as it rotated this would have to be trimmed
every half hour as it started to get larger and larger the first mid course correction came
one one hours into the flight testing on the ground had shown there was a small chance that the service propulsion system sps engine would explode when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first this could be done by burning the engine for a short period this first correction burn was only two four seconds and added about two zero four ft s six two m s prograde in the direction of travel this was less than
the two four eight ft s seven five m s planned and the shortfall was due to a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines causing lower than expected
fuel pressure requiring the crew to use the small reaction control system rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned midcourse corrections were cancelled as the trajectory was found to be perfect eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for over one six hours having been awakened about five hours before launch so it was time for frank borman to start his scheduled seven
hour sleep period it proved difficult to sleep nasa had decided that at least one crewmember should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise but the constant radio chatter with the ground and the air circulation fans made it hard to sleep as well as this sleeping in space is a somewhat unnatural experience you
cannot rest your head on a pillow and bill anders said that he would suddenly jolt awake with the sensation that he was falling apollo eight s ivb rocket stage nasa about an hour after starting his sleep period borman requested clearance to take a seconal sleeping pill but the
pill had little effect after borman slept for seven hours fitfully he awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces the crew cleaned up as best as they could borman decided that he
did not want the world to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders still wanted to tell the ground they decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could be used by the crew to tape voice recordings and telemetry which were then dumped to the ground at high speed
after recording a description of borman s illness they requested that mission control check the recording as the crew would like an evaluation of the voice comments a conference between the crew and medical
personnel was held using the unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston
on the second and third floor of which only one is used during the course of a mission during a private
communication with the crew it was decided that there was little to worry about and that it was either a two four hour flu as borman thought or just a reaction to the sleeping pill in fact it is now thought that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness it had
never arisen on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini as they had been too small to move freely in in flight footage of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the moon in the center is frank borman the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight with little happening except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and
they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast for three one hours after launch the camera used was two kg and broadcast in black and white only using a vidicon tube it had two lenses a very wide angle one six zero lens and a telephoto nine lens during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the
earth appeared however this proved impossible as the narrow angle lens was difficult to aim without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at also without proper filters the image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could do was show the people watching back on earth a bright
blob after broadcasting for one seven minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the high gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother happy birthday by this time the planned sleep
periods had completely been abandoned three two hours into the flight lovell went
to bed three hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to bed
after taking a sleeping pill somewhat strangely the crew were unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise three of the five windows had fogged up due to outgassed oils from the silicone sealant and due to the attitude required for the ptc the moon was almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft in fact it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time a second television broadcast came at five five hours this time the crew
had managed to rig up filters meant for the still cameras so that they could acquire images of the
earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth and what was visible and the colors that could be seen the
transmission lasted two three minutes lunar sphere of influence at about five five hours and four zero minutes into the flight the crew of apollo eight became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of
influence of another celestial body or to put it another way the moon s gravitational force became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened they were three eight seven five nine mi six two three
seven seven km from the moon and had a speed of three nine nine zero ft s one two one
six m s with respect to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew as they still calculated their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center and would do so until they performed their last midcourse correction when they would switch to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit it was only thirteen hours until they would be in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion was a second midcourse correction it was in retrograde against direction of
travel and slowed the spacecraft down by two zero ft s zero six m s in effect lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly six one hours after launch about two four two zero zero mi three nine zero zero zero km from the moon the crew
burned the rcs for one one seconds they would now pass seven one seven mi one one five four km from the lunar surface at six four hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion one loi one this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a go no go decision the crew was told at six eight hours they were go and riding
the best bird we can find at six eight hours and five eight minutes the spacecraft went behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with ten minutes before the loi one the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place then they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating
the lunar surface but the burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit igniting at six nine hours eight minutes and one six seconds after launch the sps burned for four minutes and one three seconds placing the crew of apollo eight in orbit around the moon the crew described this as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the right amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly
elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space if it lasted too long they could have ended up impacting the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a
chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next two zero hours the first earthrise photographed by humans on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length
of time the crew would appear early from behind the moon however this time came and went without apollo eight reappearing and then exactly at the predicted moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a one nine three three mi by six nine five mi three one one one km by one
one one nine km orbit about the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like the moon is essentially grey no color looks like plaster of paris or sort of
a grayish beach sand we can see quite a bit of detail the sea of fertility doesn t stand out as well here as it does back on earth there s not as
much contrast between that and the surrounding craters the craters are all rounded
off there s quite a few of them some of them are newer many of them look like especially the round ones look like hit by meteorites or projectiles of some sort langrenus is quite a huge crater it s got a central cone to it the walls of the crater are terraced about six or seven different s on the way down lovell continued to describe the terrain that they were passing over one of the crew
s major tasks was reconnaissance of the planned landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that would be the apollo one one landing site the
launch time of apollo eight had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for the site a film camera had been set up in one of the windows to record a
frame every second of the moon below and bill anders would spend much of the next two zero hours taking as many photographs as he could of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew would take seven zero zero photographs of the moon and one five zero of the earth a portion of the lunar near side the large crater in the bottom half of the photo is goclenius throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with the earth borman kept
asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a go no go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up the television to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters
that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed the eleven second loi two burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to seven zero zero mi by seven one three mi one one two six km by one one four eight km over the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the
moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church as he was meant to lay read during the midnight service at st christopher s episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo eight flight was unable a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service it was as the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front that the crew witnessed an event never before seen earthrise anders glanced
out the window and saw a blue and white orb and realized it was the earth instantly the crew understood
that they needed to take a photograph of this anders took both the first photograph which was black and white and then later the more famous color photo after the flight borman and anders both claimed they took the first earthrise photo lovell also did but more as
a joke than anything else it was determined that it was probably anders earth as seen from apollo eight december two four one nine six eight nasa anders continued to take
photographs while lovell took the controls of the spacecraft so that borman could get some rest as
always resting was difficult in the cramped and noisy capsule though borman was able to doze for two orbits he would awaken at times to ask a question about their status only to be told that everything was going fine borman did wake up however when he started to hear his fellow crewmembers make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having
not had a good night s sleep in over three days taking command he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the
rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed at first anders protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed at last anders agreed as long as the commander would set up the camera to continue
to take automatic shots of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted to crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the second television transmission began borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was
like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding type of existence or expanse of nothing and then
after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth the only thing left for the crew now was to perform the trans earth injection or tei which would occur two hours after the end of the television transmission this was the most critical burn of the whole flight if the sps failed to ignite then the crew would
be stuck in orbit around the moon with only about five more days of oxygen and no chance of escape and once again the burn had to be performed while the crew was out of contact with earth on the far side of the moon the burn occurred perfectly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re emerged from behind the moon at eight nine hours two eight minutes and three nine seconds the exact time predicted when voice contact was regained lovell announced
please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the capcom replied that s affirmative you are the best ones to know it was christmas day one nine six eight rupes cauchy in eastern mare tranquillitatis unplanned manual re alignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer
keyboard however an accidental entry erased some of the computer s memory
which caused the inertial measuring unit imu to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift off and fire the thrusters to correct the module s attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the
module s attitude they realized they would have to re enter data that would tell the computer its real position it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another fifteen minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re alignment under more critical conditions during the apollo one three mission after that module s imu had to be turned off to conserve energy in his one nine nine four book lost
moon the perilous voyage of apollo one three later re titled apollo one three when the movie based on it apollo one three came out lovell wrote my
training on apollo eight came in handy in that book he dismissed the incident as a planned experiment requested by the ground crew however in subsequent interviews lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident caused by his mistake as described in robert zimmerman s one nine nine
eight book genesis the story of apollo eight cruise back to earth and re entry the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would re enter two days after tei and splashdown in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth and final television broadcast this time they gave a tour of the
spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they had finished broadcasting they found a small present from deke slayton in the food locker real turkey with stuffing and three miniature bottles of brandy which remained unopened there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the apollo eight command module on the deck of the uss yorktown after two uneventful days the crew prepared for re entry the computer would control the re entry
and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude blunt end forward if the computer broke down borman would take over after separating from the service module all the crew could do was sit and wait six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earth s horizon just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists as they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma
formed around the capsule the capsule started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at six g five nine m s with the computer
controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the capsule apollo eight rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at three zero zero zero zero feet nine km the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at one zero zero zero zero feet three km by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was estimated to be when it hit the water the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over
and left it upside down in what was termed stable two position as they were buffeted by
a one zero foot three m swell borman was sick waiting for the three floatation balloons to right the capsule it was four three minutes after splashdown before the
first frogman from the uss yorktown arrived as the capsule had landed before sunrise forty
five minutes later they were on the deck of the aircraft carrier the command module is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry along with a collection of personal items from the

university campuses across the united states had seen rioting and occupation of buildings by students may had seen rioting in paris that almost led to revolution yet over all these other events time magazine chose the crew of apollo eight as their men of the year for one nine six eight recognizing them as the people that most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people to ever leave the gravitational influence of
the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even
the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty fifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollo eight can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that simply stated thank you apollo eight you saved
one nine six eight january three one nine six nine cover of time magazine with the apollo eight crew one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon although it was not the first image taken of the whole earth nor would it be the last this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture some regard the picture as being the start of
the environmentalist movement with the first earth day in one nine seven zero the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercury atlas six by john glenn in one nine six two there were one two zero zero journalists covering the mission with the bbc coverage being broadcast in five four countries in one five different languages the soviet newspaper pravda even covered the flight without the usual anti american editorializing it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw either live or delayed the
christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon it had a tremendous impact touring the world after
the mission borman met with pope paul vi he was told i have spent my entire life trying to say to the world what you did on christmas eve the militant atheist madalyn murray o hair later caused controversy by bringing
a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis she wished the courts to ban us astronauts who were all government employees from public prayer in
space this was eventually rejected by the courts but it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollo one one took communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and only obliquely referred to it at the time crew frank borman flew on gemini seven cassutt michael one nine nine five deke an autobiography forge books isbn zero three one two eight five

international variations by convention a space traveller employed by the russian aviation
and space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut cosmonaut is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt which in turn derives from the greek words kosmos universe and nautes sailor
in the usa a space traveller is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words stron star and nautes sailor for the most part cosmonaut and astronaut are synonyms in all languages and the usage of choice is often dictated by political reasons however in the united states the term astronaut is typically applied to the individual as soon as training begins while in russia an individual
is not labeled a cosmonaut until successful space flight the first known use of the term was by neil r jones in his short story the death s head meteor in one nine three zero on march one four one nine nine five astronaut norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle arguably becoming the first american cosmonaut in the process european outside of the uk space travellers are sometimes especially in french speaking countries called spationauts a hybrid word formed from
the latin spatium space and greek nautes sailor apart from the soviet union europe has not yet produced manned spacecraft but has sent men and women into space in cooperation with russia and the united states taikonaut is
sometimes used in english for astronauts from china by western news media the term was coined in may one nine nine eight by chiew lee yih from malaysia who used it first in newsgroups almost simultaneously chen lan coined it for use in the western media based on the term t ik ng literally great

proposal for preventing the children of poor people in ireland from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as a modest proposal is
a satirical pamphlet written by jonathan swift in one seven two
nine the work has now become one of the epitomes of satire and the modern phrase a modest proposal derives from the work theme the work is written in first person point of view however the narrator should not be confused
with swift himself because the writer is merely a persona he argues through economic reasoning as well as a self righteous moral stance for a way to turn the problem of squalor among the catholics in ireland into its own
solution his proposal is to fatten up the undernourished children and feed them to ireland s rich land owners children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one thus combating overpopulation and unemployment sparing
families the expense of child rearing while providing them with a little extra income improving the culinary experience of the wealthy and contributing to the overall economic well being of the nation he offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold their weight and price and the projected consumption patterns he suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more he also anticipates that
the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality husbands will treat their wives with more respect and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown his conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve ireland s complex social political and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed this is widely believed to be the greatest example of sustained
irony in the history of the english language reactions the satirical intent of a modest proposal was misunderstood by many of swift s peers and he was harshly criticized for writing prose in such exceptionally bad taste he came close to losing his patronage because of this essay the misunderstanding of the intent of the satirical attack came about largely because of the disparity between the satirical intent of the cannibalistic proposal and the sincere tone of the narrative voice modern usage in modern usage the phrase modest proposal has come to indicate a proposal that is anything but modest
such a proposal may serve to advance a cause or argument by promoting discussion on the merits of the argument s opposite other examples of modest proposals modest proposals and other literary hoaxes report from iron mountain sokal affair miscegenation origin of the word dihydrogen monoxide jack thompson attorney has been criticised for writing an open letter similar to swift s piece one that included a promise of donating money to charity external links a modest proposal gutenberg free audiobook from librivox sniggle net modest proposals satire essays non fictional british literature one seven two nine books
the alkali metals are the series of elements in group one iupac style of the periodic table excluding hydrogen in all but one rare circumstance lithium li sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr they are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental form in nature the alkali metals are silver colored caesium has a golden tinge soft low density metals which react readily with halogens to form ionic salts and with water to form strongly alkaline basic hydroxides these elements all have one electron in their outermost shell so
the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled electron shell is to lose one electron to form a singly charged positive ion hydrogen with a solitary electron is sometimes placed at the top of group one but it is not an alkali
metal except under extreme circumstances as metallic hydrogen rather it exists naturally as a diatomic gas removal of its single electron requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron for the alkali metals as in the halogens only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen forming
the negative hydride ion binary compounds of hydride with the alkali metals and some transition metals have been prepared under extremely high pressure such as is found at the core of jupiter hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal see metallic hydrogen alkali metals periodic table in logic the argument form or test form of an argument results from
replacing the different words or sentences that make up the argument with letters along the lines of algebra the letters represent logical variables the sentence forms which classify argument forms of common arguments important are studied in college logic here is an example of an argument a all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal we can rewrite argument a by putting each sentence on its own line b all humans are mortal socrates is human
therefore socrates is mortal to demonstrate the important notion of the form of an argument substitute letters for similar items throughout
b c all s are p a is s therefore a is p all we have done in c is
to put s for human and humans p for mortal and a for socrates what results c is the form of the original argument in a so argument form c is the
form of argument a moreover each individual sentence of c is the sentence form of its respective sentence in a attention is given to argument and sentence form because form is what makes an argument valid or cogent some examples of valid arguments forms are modus ponens
modus tollens and the disjunctive syllogism two invalid argument forms are affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent see also analytic proposition synthetic proposition logic an alphabet is a complete standardized set of letters basic written symbols each of which roughly represents a phoneme of a
spoken language either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past there are other systems of writing such as logograms
in which each symbol represents a morpheme or word and syllabaries in which each symbol represents a syllable the word alphabet itself comes from alpha and beta the first two symbols of the greek alphabet there are dozens of alphabets in use today most of them are linear which means that they are made up of lines notable exceptions are the braille alphabet morse code and the cuneiform alphabet of the ancient city of ugarit types the term alphabet is currently
used by linguists both in a wider and in a narrower sense in the wider sense the term refers to any script that is segmental
on the phoneme level i e that has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other subtypes abjads and abugidas the three types differ from each other in the way vowels are treated in relation to consonants abjads record only consonants and leave vowels or most vowels unexpressed in abugidas the vowels are indicated by diacritical marks or
systematic modification of the form of the consonants in alphabets in the narrow sense both consonants and vowels have separate symbols the first alphabet in the wider sense was the proto canaanite alphabet an abjad which through its successor phoenician became the ancestor of all later alphabets the first alphabet in the
narrow sense was the greek alphabet examples of present day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul
and abugidas are used to write amharic hindi and thai the canadian
aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as a glyph stands for a
consonant and is rotated to represent the vowel rather than each consonant vowel combination being represented by a separate glyph as in a true syllabary the boundaries between these three types are not always clear cut for example iraqi kurdish is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is a true alphabet other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas
on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but
all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although
short a was not written as in the abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true
alphabet conversely the vowel marks of the amharic abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the system is learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script
even more extreme the pahlavi abjad became logographic see below thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tonal languages further classification can be based on the treatment of tone though there are as yet no names
to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas this is the case for vietnamese a true alphabet and thai an abugida in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics
but the placement of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates the tone more rarely a script has separate letters for the tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang for many of these languages regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas alphabets can be quite small the book pahlavi script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters the hawaiian alphabet
is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of one eight letters including the okina and five long vowels while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated that is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes for
example a comma shaped letter represented g d y k and j however such simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated in later pahlavi papyri up to half of
the remaining graphic distinctions were lost and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all but had to be learned as word symbols that is as logograms like egyptian demotic the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of five three letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for k and j though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has
been expanded to five eight with the khutma letters letters with a dot added to represent sounds from persian and english the largest known abjad is sindhi with five one letters the largest true alphabets include kabardian and abxaz for cyrillic with five eight and five six letters respectively and slovak for the latin alphabet with four six however these scripts either include di and tri graphs similar to spanish ch or diacritics like
slovak the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably georgian with four one letters syllabaries typically include five zero to four zero zero glyphs though the m ra pirah language of
brazil would require only two four if tone were not indicated and rotokas three zero and the glyphs of logographic systems number from the hundreds to the thousands thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script it is not always clear what constitutes a distinct alphabet french uses the same basic alphabet as english but many of the letters can carry diacritic and other marks for example or in french these marks are not considered to create additional letters however in icelandic the accented letters such as
and are considered distinct letters of the alphabet some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures such as in old english and in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and by modifying existing letters such as the eth of old english and icelandic which came
from d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian or italian which only uses the letters j k x y and w for foreign words spelling each language may establish certain general rules that govern the association between letters and phonemes but depending on the language these rules
may or may not be consistently followed in a perfectly phonological alphabet the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling however languages often evolve independently of their writing systems
and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language languages may fail to achieve a one to one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways a language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single
letter two letter combinations are called digraphs and three letter groups are called trigraphs kabardian uses a tesseragraph four letters for one of
its phonemes a language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters a language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word a language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets
of vocabulary items such as the japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries or the various rules in english for spelling words from latin and greek or the original germanic vocabulary national languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard however with an international language with wide variations in its dialects such as english it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet some national languages like finnish have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one to
one correspondence between letters and phonemes the italian verb corresponding to spell compitare is unknown to many italians because the act of spelling itself is
almost never needed each phoneme of standard italian is represented in only one way however pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling because certain letters are pronounced in more than one way in standard spanish it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa
this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced french with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy at the other extreme however are languages such as english and irish where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds
in a consistent way for english this is because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels however even english has general rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the time the sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet a standard for this is the international phonetic alphabet collation an alphabet
also serves to establish an order among letters that can be used for sorting entries in lists called collating note that the order does not have to be constant among different languages using this alphabet for examples see latin alphabet collating in other languages in recent years the unicode initiative has attempted to collate most of the world s known writing systems into a single character encoding as
well as its primary purpose of standardising computer processing of non roman scripts the unicode project has provided a focus for script related scholarship the alphabet effect some communication theorists notably those associated with the so called toronto school of communications such as marshall mcluhan harold innis and more recently robert k logan have advanced hypotheses to the effect that alphabetic scripts in particular have served to promote and encourage the skills of analysis coding decoding
and classification this set of hypotheses may be known as the alphabet effect after the title of logan s one nine eight six work the theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to
the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems and this abstraction needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed in some way to the
development of the societies which use it proponents of this theory hold that the development of alphabetic as distinct to other types of writing systems has made a significant impact on western thinking and development because it introduced a new level of abstraction analysis and classification mcluhan and logan one nine seven seven postulates that as a result of these skills the use of the alphabet created
an environment conducive to the development of codified law monotheism abstract science deductive logic objective history and individualism according to logan all of these innovations including the alphabet arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the tigris euphrates river system and the aegean sea and within the very narrow time frame between two zero zero zero b c and five zero zero b c logan two zero zero four however many of these abstractions first occurred in
societies which did not use an alphabet such as the codified law of hammurabi
in babylonia which predated similar codes in societies with the alphabet since the alphabet quickly spread to become nearly ubiquitous it is difficult to trace cause and effect in this matter see also abecedarium abjad abugida akshara alphabetical order alphabets derived from the latin artificial scripts character set lipogram list of alphabets syllabary transliteration unicode a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t

atom in an atom of neutral charge the number of electrons also equals the atomic number the atomic number originally meant the number of an element s place in the periodic table when mendeleyev arranged the known chemical elements grouped by their similarities in chemistry it was noticeable that placing them in strict order of atomic mass resulted in some mismatches iodine and tellurium if listed by atomic mass appeared to be in the wrong order and would fit better if their places in the table were swapped placing them in the order which fit chemical properties
most closely their number in the table was their atomic number this number appeared to
be approximately proportional to the mass of the atom but as the discrepancy showed reflected some other property than mass the anomalies in this sequence were finally explained after research by henry gwyn jeffreys moseley in one nine one three moseley discovered a strict relationship between the x ray diffraction spectra of elements and their correct location in the periodic table it was later shown that the atomic number corresponds to the electric charge of the nucleus in other words the number of protons it is the charge which
gives elements their chemical properties rather than the atomic mass the atomic number is closely related to the mass number although they should not be confused which is the number of
protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom the mass number often comes after the name of the element e g carbon one four used in carbon dating see also periodic table list of elements by number effective atomic number

the structure and organization of living things it can be divided into animal anatomy zootomy and plant anatomy phytonomy furthermore anatomy can be covered either regionally or systemically that is studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest
for the former or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systmes for the latter major branches of anatomy include
comparative anatomy histology and human anatomy animal anatomy animal anatomy may include
the study of the structure of different animals when it is called comparative anatomy or animal morphology or it may be limited to one animal only in which case it is spoken of as special anatomy human anatomy from a utilitarian point of view the study of humans is the most important division of special anatomy and this human anatomy may be approached from different points of view from that of medicine it consists of a knowledge of the exact form position size and relationship of the
various structures of the healthy human body and to this study the term descriptive or topographical human anatomy is given though it is often less happily spoken of as anthropotomy so intricate is the human body that only a small number of professional human anatomists after
years of patient observation are complete masters of all its details most of them specialize on certain parts such as the brain or viscera contenting themselves with a good working
knowledge of the rest topographical anatomy must be learned by repeated dissection and inspection of dead human bodies it is no more a science than a pilot s knowledge is and like that knowledge must be exact and available in moments of
emergency from the morphological point of view however human anatomy is a scientific and fascinating study having for its object the discovery of the causes which have brought about the existing structure of humans and needing a knowledge of the allied sciences of embryology or developmental biology phylogeny and histology pathological anatomy or morbid anatomy is the study of diseased organs while sections of normal anatomy
applied to various purposes receive special names such as medical surgical gynaecological artistic and superficial anatomy the comparison of the anatomy of different races of humans is part of the science of physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy in
the present edition of this work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than topographically each anatomical article contains first a
description of the structures of an organ or system such as nerves arteries heart and so forth as it is found in humans this is followed by an account of the development embryology and comparative anatomy morphology as far as vertebrate animals are concerned but only those parts of
the lower animals which are of interest in explaining human body structure are here dealt with the articles have a twofold purpose first to give enough details of structure to make the articles on physiology surgery medicine and pathology intelligible and secondly to give the non expert inquirer or the worker in some other branch of science the chief theories on which the modern scientific groundwork of anatomy is built major body systems circulatory system digestive

q q therefore p this logical error is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent because it is mistakenly concluded from the second premise that the affirmation of the consequent entails the truthhood of the antecedent one way to demonstrate the invalidity is to use a counterexample here is an argument that is obviously incorrect if stephen king wrote the bible p then stephen king is a good writer q stephen king is a good writer q therefore stephen king wrote the bible p
the previous argument was obviously incorrect but the next argument may be more deceiving if someone is human p then she is mortal q anna is mortal q therefore anna is human p but in fact anna can be a cat very much
a mortal but not a human one however be aware that a similar argument form is valid in which the first premise asserts if and only if
rather than if similarly the converse of a statement can be validly assumed to be true so long as the if and only if phrase is attached see also modus

he received a classical education in moscow studying music and arabic before training for over five years at the vgik film school studying directly under mikhail romm among others he also worked as a geologist in siberia although the orthodox christian symbolism of his films led to prevarication and occasional suppression of the
finished product by the soviet authorities the soviet mosfilm studio system enabled him to
make films that would not have been commercially viable in the west however tarkovsky s principal complaint about his treatment by the authorities was that he had many more ideas in him than he was allowed to bring to the screen and in one nine eight four

work tarkovsky s films are characterised by metaphysical themes extremely long takes and memorable images of exceptional beauty recurring motifs in his films are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections and characters re appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called
sculpting in time by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it unedited movie footage transcribes time in real
time the speedy jump cutting style that is prevalent in mtv videos and hollywood movies by contrast overrides any sense of time by imposing the editor s viewpoint by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another up to and including his film mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory after mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic
unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day the sacrifice is the only film that truly reflects this ambition it is also considered by many to be a near perfect reflection of the sculpting in time theory filmography the killers one nine five eight tarkovsky s first student film at vgik the soviet state film school concentrate one nine five eight tarkovsky s second student film at vgik the soviet state film school there will be no leave today one nine five nine tarkovsky s final student film at

called ambiguous if it can be interpreted in more than one way ambiguity is distinct from vagueness which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct lexical ambiguity arises when context is insufficient to determine the sense of a single word that has more than one meaning for example the word bank has several meanings including financial institution and edge of a river but if someone says i deposited one zero zero in the bank the intended meaning is clear more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional that

t clear about which sense is intended syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can be parsed in more than one way he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies spoken language can also contain lexical ambiguities where there is more than one way to break
up a set of sounds into words for example ice cream and i scream this is rarely a problem due to the use of context philosophers and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing
ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately
conceal bad arguments for example a politician might say i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth others will think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth although in writing the correct insertion or omission of a comma after taxes removes ambiguity here the politician hopes that each will interpret the statement in the way he wants and both will think the
politician is on his side the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation also rely on the use of ambiguous words and phrases in literature and rhetoric on the other hand ambiguity can be a useful tool groucho marx
s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas what he was doing in my pajamas i ll never know songs and poetry often rely on

the result of convergent evolution not common ancestry for the same reason aardvarks bear a striking first glance resemblance to the marsupial bilbies and bandicoots of australasia which are not placental mammals at all the oldest known tubulidentata fossils have been found in kenya and date to the early miocene although the relationships of tubulidentata are unknown they are probably ungulates they spread to europe and southern asia during the later miocene and early pliocene periods three genera of the family orycteropodidae are known leptorycteropus myorycteropus and orycteropus the surviving aardvark a genus from madagascar may be related

by cementum the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously aardvarks are born with conventional incisors and canines at the
front of the jaw but these fall out and are not replaced in adult aardvarks the only teeth are the molars at the back of the jaw aardvark aardvarks are only vaguely pig like the body is stout with an arched back the limbs are of moderate length the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes but the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and

which is shaped into bricks using wooden frames and dried in the sun also known as mudbrick adobe structures are extremely durable and account for the oldest extant buildings on the planet adobe buildings also offer significant advantages in hot dry climates as they remain cooler as it stores and releases heat very slowly
the word adobe is spanish and comes from the arabic at tub the brick and from the coptic
tobe the word may be pronounced ah doh beh or uh doh bee buildings made of sun dried earth
are common in the middle east north africa and in spain usually in the mudejar style
the method of brickmaking was imported to the americas in the one six th century by spaniards a distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks and the larger adobines some of which are as much as from one to two yards long in more modern usage the term adobe has come to mean a style of architecture that is popular in the desert climates of north america especially in new mexico cf stucco detail of adobe kilns in arizona composition of adobe
an adobe brick is made of soil mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or animal dung the soil composition typically contains clay and sand straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects adobe bricks bricks are made in an open frame two five cm
one zero inches by three six cm one four inches is a reasonable size but
any convenient size is fine for your own use after the mud is put into the frame the frame is removed after a few hours the bricks are put on edge to finish drying bricks should be dried in

springing from the root each rosette is monocarpic and grows slowly to flower but once after a number of years when a tall stem or mast grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of shortly tubular flowers after development of fruit the original plant dies but suckers are frequently produced from the base of the stem which become new plants swan s neck agave agave attenuata the most familiar species is
agave americana a native of tropical america the so called century plant or american aloe the maguey of mexico the
name refers to the long time the plant takes to flower although the number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual the richness of the soil and the climate during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering during the development of the inflorescence there is a rush of sap to the base of the young flowerstalk in the case of a americana and other species this is used by the mexicans to make their national beverage pulque the
flower shoot is cut out and the sap collected and subsequently fermented by distillation a spirit called mezcal is prepared the leaves of several species yield fiber as for instance agave rigida var sisalana sisal hemp agave decipiens false sisal hemp agave americana is the source of pita fiber and is used as a fiber plant in mexico the west indies and southern europe the flowering stem of the last

introduced into europe about the middle of the one six th century and is now widely cultivated for its handsome appearance in the variegated forms the leaf has a white or yellow marginal or central stripe from base to apex as the leaves unfold
from the center of the rosette the impression of the marginal spines is very conspicuous on the still erect younger leaves the tequ plants are usually grown in tubs and put out in the summer months but in the winter require protection from frost they mature very slowly and die after flowering but are easily propagated by the offsets from the base of the stem agave nectar has been used as an alternative to sugar in
cooking the juice from many species of agave can cause acute contact dermatitis it will produce reddening and blistering lasting one to two weeks episodes of itching may recur up to a year thereafter even though there is no longer a visible rash interestingly dried parts of the plants can be handled with bare hands with little or no effect
taxonomy agaves were once classified in liliaceae but most references now include them in
their own family agavaceae agaves have long presented special difficulties for taxonomy variations within a species may be considerable and a number of named species are of unknown origin and may just be variants of original wild species spanish and portuguese explorers probably brought agaves back with them but really became popular in europe during the one nine th century with many types being imported by collectors some of have been continuously propagated by offset since then and do not consistently resemble any species known in nature although this may simply be

canal east of the ural mountains and south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas about six zero of the world s human population lives in asia of whom only two live in the northern and interior half siberia mongolia kazakhstan xinjiang tibet qinghai western
uzbekistan and turkmenistan the other nine eight live in the remaining half world map showing asia etymology the word asia entered english via latin from ancient greek asia see also list of traditional greek place names this name is first attested in herodotus c four four zero bc where it refers to asia minor or for the purposes of describing the persian wars to the persian empire as opposed to greece and egypt herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three
different women s names are used to describe a single land mass europa asia and libya referring to africa stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus but that the lydians say it was named after asias son of cotys who passed the name on to a tribe in sardis even before herodotus homer knew of a trojan ally named asios son of
hyrtacus a ruler over several towns and elsewhere he describes a marsh as iliad two four six one the greek term may be derived from assuwa a one four th century bc confederation of states in western anatolia hittite assu good is probably an element in that name alternatively the ultimate etymology of the term may be from the akkadian word w a m cognate of hebrew which means to go out or to ascend referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the middle east and also likely connected with the
phoenician word asa meaning east this may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for europe as being from semitic er
bu to enter or set of the sun however an originally mesopotamian or middle eastern
perspective would not explain how the term asia first came to be associated with anatolia as lying west of the semitic speaking area
definition and boundaries political map of asia medieval europeans considered
asia as a continent a distinct landmass the european concept of the three continents in the old world goes back to classical antiquity with the etymology of the word
rooted in the ancient near and middle east the demarcation between asia and africa is the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and europe is commonly believed to run through the dardanelles
the sea of marmara the bosporus the black sea the caucasus mountains the caspian sea the ural river to its source and the ural mountains to the kara sea near kara russia however modern discovery of the extent of africa and asia made this definition rather anachronistic especially in the case of asia which would have several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if these criteria were
used for example south asia and east asia geologists and physical geographers no longer consider asia and europe to be
separate continents it is either defined in terms of geological landmasses physical geography or tectonic plates geology in the former case europe is a western peninsula of eurasia or the africa eurasia landmass in the latter europe and asia are still part of the eurasian plate which excludes the arabian and indian tectonic plates in human geography there are two schools of thought one school follows historical convention and treats europe and asia as
different continents categorizing europe east asia the orient south asia british india and the middle east arabia and persia as specific regions for more detailed analysis the other schools equate the word continent in terms of geographical region when referring to europe and use the term region to describe asia in terms of physical
geography because in linguistic terms continent implies a distinct landmass it is becoming increasingly common to substitute the term region for continent to avoid the problem of disambiguation altogether there is much confusion in european languages with the term asian because a category implies homogenity the term asian almost always refers to a subcategory of people from asia rather than referring to asian defined in term of asia the fact that in american english asian refers to east asian orientals while in british english asian refers to south asian reflects this confusion sometimes it is not even clear
exactly what asia consists of some definitions exclude turkey the middle east and or russia the term is sometimes used more strictly in reference to asia pacific which does not include the middle east or russia but does include islands in the pacific ocean a number of which may also be considered part of australasia and or oceania asia contains the indian subcontinent arabian subcontinent as well as a piece of the north american plate in siberia geographical regions satellite view of asia as already mentioned asia is a subregion of
eurasia for further subdivisions based on that term see north
eurasia and central eurasia some asian countries stretch beyond asia see bicontinental country for details about the borderline cases between asia and europe asia and africa and asia
and oceania the following subregions of asia are traditionally recognized central asia east asia far east north asia south asia or indian subcontinent southeast asia southwest asia or middle east or west asia central asia there is no absolute consensus in the usage
of this term usually central asia includes the central asian republics of kazakhstan excluding its small european territory uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan afghanistan
mongolia and the western regions of china are also sometimes included former soviet states in the caucasus region central asia is currently geopolitically important because international disputes and conflicts over oil pipelines nagorno karabakh and chechnya as well as
the presence of u s military and u k military forces in afghanistan east asia this area includes the pacific ocean island countries of taiwan and japan north and south korea on the korean peninsula china but sometimes only the eastern regions sometimes the nations of mongolia
and vietnam are also included in east asia more informally southeast asia is included in east asia on some occasions north asia this term is rarely used by geographers but usually it refers to the bigger asian part of russia also known as siberia sometimes the northern parts of other asian nations such as kazakhstan are also included in northern asia south asia or indian subcontinent south asia is also referred to as the indian subcontinent it includes the himalayan states of india pakistan nepal bhutan and bangladesh the indian ocean nations of sri lanka
and the maldives india s andaman nicobar and lakshadweep islands also lie in the indian ocean the peninsular india also known as the deccan plateau sometimes afghanistan is also included into this category southeast asia this region contains the malay peninsula indochina and islands in the indian ocean and pacific ocean the countries it contains are in mainland southeast asia the countries myanmar thailand laos cambodia
and vietnam in maritime southeast asia the countries of malaysia brunei the philippines singapore and indonesia some of the indonesian islands also lie in the melanesia region of oceania east timor also melanesian is sometimes included
too the country of malaysia is divided in two by the south china sea and thus has both a mainland and island part southwest asia or middle east near east or west asia this can also be called by the western term middle east which is commonly used by europeans and americans middle east to some interpretations is often used to also refer to some countries in north africa southwest asia can be further divided into anatolia i e asia minor constituting the asian part of turkey the island nation of cyprus in the mediterranean sea the levant
or near east which includes syria israel jordan lebanon iraq and the asian portion of egypt the arabian peninsula including saudi arabia united arab emirates bahrain qatar oman yemen and kuwait the caucasus region which straddles both asia and europe namely transcaucasia including a small portion of russia and arguably most if not all of georgia armenia and azerbaijan the iranian plateau containing iran and parts of other neighbouring nations economy in terms of gross domestic product ppp the largest national economy within asia is that of the prc people s republic of china over

the world s supply of clothing and footwear now originates in southeast asia financial and other services asia has three main financial centers they are in hong kong singapore and tokyo call centers are becoming major employers in india and the philippines due to the availablity of many well educated english speakers the rise of the business process outsourcing industry has seen the rise of india and china as the other financial centers early history map of asia one eight nine two
the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions linked by the interior mass of the central asian steppe the coastal periphery was home to some of the world s earliest known civilizations each of them developing around fertile river valleys the civilizations in mesopotamia the indus valley and the yangtze shared many similarities and may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel other innovations such as that of writing seem to have been developed individually
in each area cities states and empires developed in these lowlands the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse mounted nomads and from the steppes they could reach all areas of asia the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo europeans who spread their languages into the middle east india and in the tocharians to the borders of china the northernmost part of asia including much of siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests
the climate and the tundra these areas remained very sparsely populated the centre and the peripheries were
mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could
cross only with difficulty while technologically and socially the urban city dwellers were more advanced in many cases they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe however the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a
large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in china india and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies population density the following table lists countries and dependencies by population density in inhabitants and km

debate the articles were ratified three years later on march one one
seven eight one the articles were eventually replaced by the united states constitution on june two one one seven eight eight when the ninth state new
hampshire ratified the constitution according to their own terms for modification however the articles were still in effect until one seven nine zero when every one of the one three states had ratified the new constitution ratification the articles of confederation were submitted to the states for ratification on november one seven one seven seven seven accompanied by a letter from congress urging that the document
be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength to maintain and defend our common liberties the document only became effective as it was ratified by the states this process dragged on for several years stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in
the west maryland was the last hold out it refused to ratify until virginia and new york agreed to rescind their claims to lands in the ohio river valley all of the colonies rebelling against britain ratified it by one seven eight one although congress debated the articles for over a year it requested immediate action on the part of the states on february five one seven seven eight south carolina became the first state to ratify the articles of confederation however three and a half years passed before the final
ratification by maryland on march one one seven eight one article summaries even though the articles of confederation and the constitution were established by much of the same people they were still very different the document contained one three articles a conclusion and a signatory section establishes the name of the confederation as the united states of america explains the rights possessed by any state and the amount of power to which any state is entitled establishes the united states as a
league of states united for their common defense the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them establishes freedom of movement anyone can pass freely between states excluding paupers vagabonds

in the state in which the crime was committed allocates one vote in the congress of the confederation united states in congress assembled to each state which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members members of congress were appointed by state legislatures individuals could
not serve more than three out of any six years limits the powers of states to conduct foreign relations and to declare war when an army is raised for common defense colonels and military ranks below colonel will

new state into the confederacy preapproves canada if they apply for membership reaffirms that the confederation accepts war debt incurred by congress before the articles assumption declares that the articles are perpetual and can only be altered by approval of congress with
ratification by all the state legislatures still at war with the kingdom of great britain the colonists were reluctant to establish another powerful national government jealously guarding their new independence the continental congress created a loosely structured unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states at the expense of the confederation while calling on congress to regulate military and monetary affairs for example the articles of confederation provided no mechanism to ensure states complied with requests for troops or revenue at times this left the military in a precarious position as george washington wrote
in a one seven eight one letter to the governor of massachusetts john hancock the end of the war the treaty of paris one seven eight three ending hostilities with
great britain languished in congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature yet congress had no power to enforce attendance writing to george clinton in september one seven eight three george washington complained
congress have come to no determination yet respecting the peace establishment nor am i able to
say when they will i have lately had a conference with a committee on this subject and have reiterated my former opinions but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss great national points function the articles supported the congressional direction of the continental army and allowed the thirteen colonies to
present a unified front when dealing with the european powers but as an instrument of government they were largely a failure congress could make decisions but had no power to enforce them perhaps the most important power that congress was denied was the power of taxation congress could only request money from the states understandably the states did not generally comply with the requests in full leaving the confederation chronically short of funds the states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war and paying congressional debts became a major issue nevertheless
the continental congress did take two actions with lasting impact the land ordinance of one seven eight five established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later american expansion the northwest ordinance of one seven eight seven noted the agreement of the original
states to give up western land claims and cleared the way for the entry of new states once the unity demanded by the
revolutionary war became unnecessary the continental army was largely disbanded a very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against indian attacks meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and one one of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met in one seven eight three washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but
riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced the congress to leave philadelphia on june two one
revision in may one seven eight six charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries unanimous approval was necessary to make the
alterations however and congress failed to reach a consensus in september five states assembled in the annapolis convention one seven eight six to discuss adjustments
that would improve commerce under their chairman alexander hamilton they invited state representatives to convene in philadelphia to discuss improvements to the federal government after debate congress endorsed the plan to revise the articles of confederation on february two one one seven eight seven according to some historians the articles were flawed in particular the confederal government was unable to settle state disputes on issues like trade and had no power to tax directly after all the states were thirteen individual republics it took
radical action to strip them of that sovereignty lessons although
ultimately replaced by the united states constitution the articles of confederation provided stability during the american revolutionary war years most importantly the experience of drafting and living under this initial document provided valuable lessons in self governance and somewhat tempered fears about a powerful central government still reconciling the turmoil between
state and federal authority continues to challenge america as seen in such conflicts as the one eight three two nullification crisis the american civil war one eight six one six five post civil war reconstruction and the supreme court s landmark brown v board of education decision in one nine five four signatures the
copy of the articles in the u s national archives has a series of signatures on page six a list of them is presented here the signing of the articles was a process that has caused some confusion the articles were approved for distribution to the states on november one five one seven seven
seven a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned and a cover letter had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson who were the president and secretary to the congress but the articles at that time were unsigned and the date was blank congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june two seven one seven seven eight
they ordered a final copy prepared the one in the national archives and that delegates should inform
the secretary of their authority for ratification then on july nine one seven seven eight the prepared copy was ready they dated it and began to sign they also requested
each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed on that date delegates present from new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york pennsylvania virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified new jersey delaware and maryland could not since their states had not ratified north carolina and georgia also didn t sign that day since their delegations were absent after the first signing some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended for example
john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august eight john penn was the first of north carolina s delegates to arrive on july one zero
and the delegation signed the articles on july two one one seven seven eight the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation georgia signed on
july two four new jersey on november two six and delaware on february one two one seven seven nine after a wait of two years maryland ratified and her delegates signed the articles on march one one seven eight one the articles were finally in force congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half

one eight seven three was one of the founders of modern geology he proposed the devonian period of the geological timescale and later the cambrian period the latter proposal was based on work which he did on welsh rock strata sedgwick was born in dent at that time in yorkshire the third child of an anglican vicar he was educated at sedbergh school and trinity college cambridge introduction in one eight one seven he took holy orders and in one eight one
eight he became woodwardian professor of geology at the university of cambridge department of earth sciences holding a chair that had been endowed ninety
years before by the natural historian john woodward he lacked formal training in geology but he quickly became an active researcher in geology and paleontology during his tenure he immensely enlarged the geological collections of cambridge university and carried out important field research all over great britain sedgwick is said to have remarked upon being appointed woodwardian professor hitherto i have never turned a stone henceforth i will leave no stone unturned in one eight two two he carried out fieldwork unraveling the complex geology
of the lake district of northern england armed with the new discoveries and techniques of william smith he met and befriended the poet william wordsworth on this expedition and also met the poet robert southey and the chemist john dalton his lectures at cambridge were immensely popular he was a spellbinding lecturer and breaking with the traditions of his time his lectures were open to women whom sedgwick thought
could make great contributions to natural history he continued to rise in his profession in one eight two nine he became president of the geological society of london and in one eight four five a vice master of trinity college as vice master he led campaigns to open cambridge to non anglicans and to reorganize the academic programs in
the process meeting and becoming close to queen victoria and her consort prince albert by the one eight five zero s he was in poor health cared for by his niece isabella still he kept giving his famous lectures
until one eight seven one early work sedgwick was one of several great figures in what has been called the heroic age of geology the
time when the great geological time periods were defined and when much exploration and fundamental research was carried out sedgwick s work placed him at the epicenter of one of the most heated geological controversies of his day stemming from his work with the gentleman geologist roderick murchison they explored the geology of scotland in one eight two
seven and in one eight three nine they jointly presented their researches on certain rocks in devon england which had
a distinctive fossil assemblage that led them to propose a new division of the geological time scale the devonian in the early one eight three zero s both men were working on the rocks of wales which were
and are very difficult to work on due to extensive folding and faulting however they seemed to be older than most of the sedimentary rocks farther east murchison documented the presence of a distinctive set of fossils one in which very few fish were found but that included numerous different types of trilobites brachiopods and other such fossils murchison named the system of rocks
containing such fossils the silurian after the silures a celtic tribe living in the welsh borderlands at the time of the romans sedgwick who had been working in central
wales proposed the existence of a separate system below the silurian which he named the cambrian after cambria the latin name for wales the two presented a joint paper in one eight three five entitled on the silurian and
cambrian systems exhibiting the order in which the older sedimentary strata succeed each other in england and wales sedgwick s upper cambrian overlapped with the lower part of murchison s silurian sedgwick had defined his cambrian using physical characters of the rocks which were unique to wales and had not relied extensively on fossils which could be found everywhere murchison who had used fossils extensively in defining the silurian
claimed at first that the upper cambrian and then the
entire cambrian were really parts of the silurian the resulting quarrel between the two men left them permanently estranged and took years to resolve there was more than a simple matter of names involved both geologists wanted the honour of describing the rocks that recorded the beginning of life on earth for no fossils were known that were older than those of the cambrian murchison felt that the fossils of sedgwick s cambrian
were not different enough from his silurian forms to merit the naming of a geologic time period and it was some time before truly distinctive cambrian fossils were documented today following the solution worked out in one eight seven nine by sedgwick s colleague charles lapworth geologists use both time periods with a third one the ordovician
also named for a celtic tribe in wales between the cambrian and the silurian equivalent to the disputed upper cambrian lower silurian beds each one of these is now known to be characterized by distinct fossil assemblages disagreement with darwin for one summer of his work in wales which was to lead to this controversy sedgwick made a fateful choice of field assistant a young cambridge graduate named charles darwin darwin had passed his examinations for
the bachelor of arts degree in january one eight three one and began attending sedgwick s geology lectures which he found fascinating that summer the two men explored the rocks of north wales darwin got a crash course in field geology from sedgwick an experience that would stand him in good stead over the next five years on the round the world voyage of hms beagle during this voyage darwin sent rocks and fossils from south america back to sedgwick as well as descriptions of the geology of south
america these impressed sedgwick who wrote in a letter to darwin s family he is doing admirably in s america he was inducted into the society shortly after his return the two stayed friends until sedgwick s death but sedgwick was upset and disappointed by darwin s theory of
evolution by natural selection after reading the origin of species sedgwick candidly wrote to darwin on november two four one eight five nine if i did not think you a good tempered parts i laughed at till my sides were almost sore other parts i read with absolute sorrow because i think them utterly false however
despite this difference of opinion the two men remained friendly until sedgwick s death flawed opinions sedgwick s
own geological views were generally catastrophic he believed that the history of the earth had been
marked by a series of cataclysmic events which had destroyed much of the earth s life in this belief he followed cuvier and he was
opposed to charles lyell s models of slow gradual geological change and a more or less steady state earth however sedgwick was interested in the possibility that at least some of the catastrophic changes implied by the rock record might be shown to be gradual he originally followed his colleague william buckland in believing that the uppermost pleistocene deposits had been laid down by the biblical flood but retracted this belief after many of these deposits turned out to have been formed by glaciers not floods sedgwick
also did not object to evolution or development as such theories were called then
in the broad sense to the fact that the life on earth had changed over time nor was he a young earth creationist he believed that the earth must be extremely old as darwin wrote of sedgwick s lectures what a capital hand is sedgewick sic for drawing large
cheques upon the bank of time however sedgwick believed in the divine creation of life over long periods of time by a power i cannot imitate or comprehend but in which i believe by a legitimate conclusion of sound reason drawn from the laws of harmonies of nature what sedgwick objected to was the apparent amoral and materialist nature of darwin s proposed mechanism natural selection which he thought degrading to humanity s spiritual aspirations his letter of november two four went on to state this view of nature you have stated admirably tho
admitted by all naturalists but how came it about here in
language if i do not mistake your meaning you have done your best in one or two pregnant cases to break it
were it possible which thank god it is not to break it humanity in my mind would suffer a damage that might brutalize it sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history external links sedgwick museum cambridge sedgwick club cambridge university of cambridge department of earth sciences one seven eight five births one eight seven three deaths alumni of trinity college cambridge british geologists fellows of the royal society natives of cumbria aa river may

he was born k sztler artur hungarians put the surname first in budapest hungary to a german speaking hungarian family of ashkenazi jewish descent his father henrik was an industrialist and inventor whose business ideas revealed flawed judgement for example he invested for a while in the manufacture of a kind of radioactive soap when artur was one four his family moved to
vienna austria in one nine one eight hungary obtained its independence from austria and flirted for a while with bolshevism koestler studied science and psychology at the university of vienna where he became involved in zionism after completing his studies he worked as a news correspondent
from one nine two six to one nine two nine he lived in the british mandate of palestine partly in a kibbutz he joined the german communist party in one nine three one but left it after the stalinist purges of one nine three eight during this period he traveled extensively in the soviet union and climbed mount ararat in turkey in turkmenistan he met the black american writer langston hughes in one nine three one he was a member of a zeppelin expedition to the north pole in his memoir the invisible writing koestler recalls that during
the summer of one nine three five he wrote about half of a satirical novel called the good soldier schweik goes to war again it had been commissioned by willy m nzenberg the comintern s chief propagandist in the west but was vetoed by the party on the grounds of the book s pacifist errors p two eight three soon after the outbreak of
world war ii the french authorities detained him for several months in a camp for resident aliens at le vernet in the foothills of the pyrenees mountains upon his release he joined the french foreign legion he eventually escaped to england via morocco and portugal in england he served in the british army as a member of the british pioneer corps one nine four one four two then worked for the bbc he became a british subject in one nine four five he returned to
france after the war where he rubbed shoulders with the set gravitating around jean paul sartre and simone de beauvoir one of the characters in de beauvoir s novel the mandarins is believed based on koestler he returned to london and spent the rest of his life writing and lecturing he was made a cbe in the one nine seven zero s in one nine eight three koestler suffering from parkinson s
disease and leukemia committed joint suicide by taking an overdose of drugs with his third wife cynthia he had long been an advocate of voluntary euthanasia and in one nine eight one had become vice president of exit a british group campaigning for it his will endowed the chair of parapsychology at the university of edinburgh in scotland
multilingualism in addition to his mother tongue german koestler became fluent in hungarian english and french and knew some hebrew and russian his biographer david cesarani claims there is some evidence that koestler may have picked up some yiddish from his grandfather koestler s multilingualism was principally due to his having resided worked and or studied in hungary austria germany palestine pre independence israel the soviet union
the united kingdom and france all by four zero years of age though he wrote the bulk of his later work in english koestler wrote his best known novels in three different languages the gladiators in hungarian darkness at noon in german although the original is now lost and arrival and departure in english his journalism was written in german hebrew french and english he claimed to have produced the
first hebrew language crossword puzzles women koestler was married to dorothy asher one nine three five five zero mamaine paget one nine five zero five two and cynthia jefferies one nine six five eight three he also had a very short fling with the french writer simone
de beauvoir one that may explain the mutual animosity between him and jean paul sartre david cesarani claimed that koestler beat and raped several women including film director jill craigie the resulting protests led to the removal of a bust of koestler from public display at the university of edinburgh questions have also been raised by
his suicide pact with his last spouse although he was terminally ill at the time she was apparently healthy leading some to claim he wrongly persuaded her
to take her own life mixed legacy just as darkness at noon was selling well during the cold war of the four zero s and five zero s koestler announced his retirement from politics much of what he wrote thereafter revealed a multidisciplinary thinker whose work anticipated a number of trends by many years he was among the
first to experiment with lsd in a laboratory he also wrote about japanese and indian mysticism in the lotus and the robot one nine six zero he did not merely arrive at different answers to accepted questions rather he tended to ask questions that no one else thought to ask this originality resulted in an uneven set of ideas and conclusions some of them such as his work on creativity insight and outlook act of creation and the history of science the
sleepwalkers are arguably brilliant and challenge us to readjust our thinking some of his other pursuits such as his interest in the paranormal his support for euthanasia his theory of the origin of ashkenazi jews like himself and his disagreement with darwinism are more controversial politics koestler was involved in a number of political causes during his life from zionism and communism to anti communism voluntary euthanasia and campaigns against capital punishment particularly hanging he was also an early advocate of nuclear disarmament journalism until the bestseller status of darkness at noon made him financially comfortable koestler often earned
his living as a journalist and foreign correspondent trading on his ability to write quickly in several languages and to acquire with facility a working knowledge of a new language he wrote for a variety of newspapers including vossische zeitung science editor and b z am mittag foreign editor in the one nine two zero s in the early one nine three zero s he worked for the ullstein publishing group in berlin and did freelance writing for the french press while covering the spanish civil war in one nine three seven he
was captured and held for several months by the falangists in m laga until the british foreign office negotiated his release his spanish testament records these experiences which he soon transformed into his classic prison novel darkness at noon after his release from spanish detention koestler worked for the news chronicle then edited die zukunft with willi m nzenberg an anti nazi anti stalinist german language paper based in paris founded in one nine three eight during and after wwii he wrote for a number of english and american
papers including the sunday telegraph on various subjects science during the last three zero years of his life koestler wrote extensively on science and scientific practice the post modernist scepticism colouring much of this writing tended to
alienate most of the scientific community a case in point is his one nine seven one book the case of the midwife toad about the biologist paul kammerer who claimed to find
experimental support for lamarckian inheritance mysticism and a fascination with the paranormal imbued much of his later work and greatly influenced his personal life he left a substantial part of his estate to establish the koestler institute at the university of edinburgh dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena his the roots of coincidence centered on yet another line of unconventional research by paul kammerer this time his
claim of a quantum theory of coincidence or synchronicity a theory koestler evaluated in light of the writings of carl jung more controversial were koestler s studies of levitation and telepathy judaism although a lifelong atheist koestler s ancestry was jewish his biographer david cesarani has claimed that koestler deliberately disowned his jewish ancestry koestler s book the thirteenth tribe advanced the controversial thesis that ashkenazi jews are not descended from the israelites of antiquity but from the khazars a turkic people
in the caucasus who converted to judaism in the eight th century and were later forced to move westwards into current russia ukraine and poland koestler stated that part of his intent in writing the thirteenth tribe was to defuse anti semitism by undermining the identification of european jews with biblical jews with the hope
of rendering anti semitic epithets such as christ killer inapplicable ironically koestler s thesis that ashkenazi jews are
not semitic has become an important claim of many anti semitic groups some palestinians have eagerly seized upon this thesis believing
that to identify most jews as non semites seriously undermines their historical claim to the
land of israel the thesis of the thirteenth tribe has since been criticized to date the genetic evidence has been inconclusive some researchers claim to find a middle eastern genetic element in virtually all ashkenazim others note both turkic words and turkic genetic markers in these populations but the
usefulness of genetic markers in determining ancestry can be problematic for instance ashkenazim also display a high level of similarity to the genetic markers of khoisan bushmen in southern africa a thorough review of the scientific literature can
be found at khazaria com when koestler resided in palestine during the one nine two zero s he lived on a kibbutz an experience forming the basis of his unfinished thieves in the night his view of israel was that it would never be destroyed short of a second shoah he supported the
statehood of israel but opposed a diaspora jewish culture in an interview published in the london jewish chronicle around the time of israel s
founding koestler asserted that all jews should either migrate to israel or assimilate completely into their local cultures koestler was also no dogmatic zionist for instance he proposed that israel drop the hebrew alphabet for the roman cultural influence in
his younger days the singer sting was an avid reader of koestler his band of the time the police were to
name one of their albums ghost in the machine after one of koestler s books the title synchronicity was also inspired by koestler s the roots of coincidence which mentions carl jung s theory of the same name koestler knew little
about the burgeoning new wave music scene and is alleged to have said look at this did you ever see a magazine called the new musical express it turns out there is a pop group called the police i don t know why they are called that presumably to distinguish them from the punks and they ve made an album of my essay the ghost in the machine i didn t know anything about it until my clipping agency sent me

water over the ridge is less than two seven zero zero metres eight nine zero zero ft in most places and several mountain peaks rise above the water forming islands the south atlantic ocean has an additional submarine ridge the walvis ridge the mid atlantic ridge separates the atlantic ocean into two large troughs with depths averaging between three seven zero zero and five five zero zero metres one two zero zero zero and one eight zero zero zero ft transverse
ridges running between the continents and the mid atlantic ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins some of the larger basins are the guiana
north american cape verde and canaries basins in the north atlantic the largest south atlantic basins are the angola cape argentina and brazil basins the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat although numerous seamounts and some guyots exist several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean
floor the puerto rico trench in the north atlantic is the deepest the
laurentian abyss is found off the eastern coast of canada in the south atlantic the south sandwich trench reaches a depth of eight four two eight metres two seven six five one ft a third major trench the romanche trench is located near the equator and reaches a depth
of about seven four five four metres two four four five five ft
the shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about one one of the bottom topography in addition a number
of deep channels cut across the continental rise ocean sediments are composed of terrigenous pelagic
and authigenic material terrigenous deposits consist of sand mud and rock particles formed by erosion weathering and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea these materials are largely found on the continental shelves and are thickest off the mouths
of large rivers or off desert coasts pelagic deposits which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor include red clays and globigerina pteropod and siliceous oozes covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from six zero metres to three three zero zero metres two zero zero ft to one one zero zero zero ft they are thickest in the convergence
belts and in the zones of upwelling authigenic deposits consist of such materials as manganese nodules they occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits water characteristics the
salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from three three to three seven parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean
maximum salinity values occur at about two five north latitude surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation precipitation river inflow and melting of sea ice surface water temperatures which vary with latitude current systems and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy range from less than two c to two nine c two eight f to eight four f maximum temperatures occur north of the equator and minimum values are found in the polar regions in the middle latitudes the
area of maximum temperature variations values may vary by seven c to eight c one three f to one five f the atlantic ocean consists of four major water masses the north and south atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters the sub antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of one zero zero zero metres three three

and is also the spawning ground for the european eel due to the coriolis effect water in the north atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction whereas water circulation in the south atlantic is counter clockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi diurnal that is two high tides occur during each two four lunar hours the
tides are a general wave that moves from south to north in latitudes above four zero north some east west oscillation occurs climate waves in the trade winds in the atlantic ocean areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes the climate of the atlantic ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters because of the oceans great capacity for
retaining heat maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through
evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest climatic zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in the high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents contribute to climatic control
by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents the gulf stream for example warms the atmosphere of the british isles and northwestern europe and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern canada the grand banks area and the northwestern coast of africa in general winds tend to transport moisture and
warm or cool air over land areas hurricanes develop in the southern part of the north atlantic ocean history and economy the atlantic ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world s oceans after the southern ocean evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to one eight zero million years ago when the continents that formed from the breakup

americas known as transatlantic trade numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken including those by the german meteor expedition columbia university s lamont geological observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office the ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world s richest fishing
resources especially in the waters covering the shelves the major species of fish caught are cod haddock hake herring and mackerel the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the shelf area off nova scotia georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks eel lobster and whales have also been taken in great quantities all

world factbook atlantic ocean atlantic ocean oceans arthur schopenhauer february two two one seven eight eight september two one one eight six zero was a german philosopher he is most famous for his work the world as will and representation he is commonly known for having espoused a sort of philosophical pessimism that saw life as being essentially evil futile and full of suffering however upon closer inspection in accordance with eastern thought especially that of
hinduism and buddhism he saw salvation deliverance or escape from suffering in aesthetic contemplation sympathy for others and ascetic living his ideas profoundly influenced the fields of philosophy psychology music and literature life schopenhauer was born in one seven eight eight in sztutowo poland near gda sk he was the son of heinrich floris schopenhauer and johanna schopenhauer a middle class mercantile family of dutch heritage although they had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism indeed the name arthur was selected by his father especially because it was the same in
english german and french his parents were both from the city and johanna
was an author as well after the city was annexed by prussia during the second partition of poland in one seven nine three the schopenhauer family fled to hamburg in one eight zero five schopenhauer s father died possibly by suicide and johanna moved to weimar because of a promise to pursue a business career schopenhauer remained in hamburg his disgust of this career however drove
him away to join his mother in weimar after only a year he never got along with his mother when the writer goethe who was a friend of johanna schopenhauer told her that he thought her son was destined for great things johanna objected she had never heard there could be two geniuses in a single family schopenhauer studied at the university of g ttingen and was awarded a phd from the university of jena in one eight two zero
schopenhauer became a lecturer at the university of berlin it was there that his opposition to hegel began while in berlin schopenhauer became involved in a consuming lawsuit from a caroline marquet she asked for damages from him a man of
independent means on the basis that she had been injured when schopenhauer allegedly pushed her marquet had noisily attracted schopenhauer s attention then marquet s companion witnessed her as being prostrate outside
of his apartment marquet claimed that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway in this manner she succeeded in gaining through the court a portion of schopenhauer s limited wealth he had to make payments for many years his reputation was permanently damaged by her legal machination schopenhauer s health deteriorated during the year of one eight six zero he died of natural causes on september two one of the same year at the age of seven two schopenhauer called himself a kantian and despised
hegel he formulated a pessimistic philosophy that gained importance and support after the failure of the german and austrian revolutions of one eight four eight philosophy schopenhauer s starting point was kant s division of the universe into phenomenon and noumenon claiming that the noumenon was the same as that in us which we call will it is the inner content and the driving force of the world for schopenhauer human will had ontological primacy
over the intellect in other words desire is understood to be prior to thought and in a parallel sense will is said to be prior to being in solving alleviating the fundamental problems of life schopenhauer was rare among philosophers in considering philosophy and logic less important or less effective than art certain types of charitable practice loving kindness in his terms and certain forms of religious discipline schopenhauer concluded that discursive thought
such as philosophy and logic could neither touch nor transcend the nature of desire i e the will in the world as will and representation schopenhauer posited that humans living in the realm of objects are living in the realm of desire and thus are eternally tormented by that desire his idea of the role of desire in life is similar to that
of vedanta hinduism and buddhism and schopenhauer draws attention to these similarities himself while schopenhauer s philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary his methodology was resolutely empirical rather than speculative or transcendental schopenhauer s identification of the kantian noumenon i e the actually existing entity with what we call our will deserves some explanation the noumenon was what kant called the ding an sich the thing in itself the reality that is the foundation of our sensory and mental representations of an external world
in kantian terms those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena schopenhauer s assertion that what we call our will is the same as this noumenon might at first instance strike some as oddly as heraclitus s revelation that everything is made out of fire but kant s philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical philosophical skepticism of david hume and his fellow british empiricists who claimed that as far as we could tell there was no outside reality beyond our mental representations
of it schopenhauer begins by arguing that kant s demarcation between external objects knowable only as phenomena and the thing in itself of noumenon contains a significant omission there is in fact one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception it is our own body we know our human bodies have boundaries and occupy space the same way other objects known only through our named senses do though we seldom think of our bodies as physical objects we know even before reflection that it shares
some of their properties we understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the
same space as an oncoming truck we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own bodies we would obtain similar results we know this even if we do not understand the physics involved we know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body most of us
possess the power of voluntary motion we usually are not aware of our lungs breath or our heartbeat unless our attention is called to it our ability to control either is limited our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose few of us have any idea what our livers are doing
right now though this organ is as needful as lungs heart or kidneys the conscious mind is the servant not the master of these and other organs these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose and has limited power over when schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the
desires needs and impulses in us that we name will what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will we cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning through will we know without thinking that the world can stimulate us we suffer fear or desire these states arise involuntarily they arise prior to reflection they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay the rational mind is for schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a
stream of pre reflective and largely unconscious emotion that stream is will and through will if not through logic we can participate in the
underlying reality that lies beyond mere phenomena it is for this reason that schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with what we call our will also schopenhauer s philosophy could be considered as
panpsychism and solipsism and in some way gnostic psychology schopenhauer was perhaps even more influential in his treatment of man s mind than he was in the realm of philosophy philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the
tribulations of love but schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly we should be surprised that a matter that generally plays such an important part in the life of man love has hitherto been almost entirely disregarded by philosophers and lies before us as raw and untreated material he gave a name to a force within man which he felt invariably had precedence over reason the will to live wille zum leben defined as an inherent drive within human beings and indeed all creatures to stay alive and to reproduce schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either
trifling or accidental but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man s psyche and dramatically shaping the world the ultimate
aim of all love affairs is more important than all other aims in man s life and therefore
it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it what is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the
next generation these ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for darwin s theory of evolution nietzsche s will to power and freud s concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind aesthetics see main article schopenhauer s aesthetics this wild and powerful drive to reproduce
however caused suffering and pain in the world for schopenhauer one way to escape the
suffering inherent in a world of will was through art through art schopenhauer thought the thinking subject could be jarred out of their limited individual perspective to feel a sense of the universal
metaphysics directly the universal in question of course was the will the contest of personal desire with a world that was by nature inimical
to its satisfaction is inevitably tragical therefore the highest place in art was given to tragedy music was also given a special status in schopenhauer s aesthetics as it did not rely upon the medium of representation to communicate a sense
of the universal schopenhauer believed the function of art to be a meditation on the unity of human nature and an attempt to either demonstrate or directly communicate to the audience a certain existential angst for which most forms of entertainment including bad art only provided a distraction a wide range of authors from thomas hardy to woody allen and artists have been influenced by this system of aesthetics and in the two zero th century this area of schopenhauer s work garnered more
attention and praise than any other according to daniel albright two zero zero five schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will
itself politics schopenhauer s politics were for the most part a much diminished echo of his system of ethics the latter being expressed in die beiden grundprobleme der ethik available in english as two separate books on the basis of morality and on the freedom of the will ethics also occupies about one fourth of his central work the world as will and representation in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralimpomena
and manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government what was essential he thought was that the state should leave each man free to work out his own salvation and so long as government was thus limited he would prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of his fellow rats i e a monarch schopenhauer did however share the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and of state violence to check the destructive
tendencies innate to our species schopenhauer by his own admission did not give much thought to politics and several times he writes prideful boasts of how little attention he had paid to political affairs of his day in a
life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government and a few continent shaking wars he did indeed maintain his aloof position of minding not the times but the eternities schopenhauer on women schopenhauer is also famous for his essay on women ber die weiber in which he expressed
his opposition to what he called teutonico christian stupidity on female affairs he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey and opposed schiller s poem in honor of women w rde der frauen the essay does give two compliments however that women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others however the latter was
discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue the ultra intolerant view of women contrasts with schopenhauer s generally liberal views on other social issues he was strongly against taboos on issues like suicide and masochism and condemned the treatment
of african slaves this polemic on female nature has since been fiercely attacked as misogynistic however he did not hold a universally negative opinion of women in particular one should note that schopenhauer had a very high opinion of madame de guyon whose writings and biography he highly recommended in any case the controversial writing has influenced many from nietzsche to one nine th century feminists while schopenhauer s hostility to women may tell us more about his biography than about philosophy his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes and their separate
roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists in the twentieth century schopenhauer on homosexuality schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of greek philosophy to address the subject of male homosexuality in the third expanded edition of the world as will and representation one eight five six
schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love in it he develops the idea that since only mature men and fully adult but pre menopausal women are capable of bearing healthy children in early adolescence and in late middle age the sexual appetite is susceptible of being turned towards another channel while there
may again be more autobiography than analysis in this hypothesis it is consistent with the general tenor of schopenhauer s thought which gives the will in nature the position of setting an agenda for individual lives it is also one of the first attempts at portraying homosexuality as a natural phenomenon acknowledging its existence
in every culture and seeking to explain its appearance even in those cultures whose moralities sharply condemn homosexual behaviour schopenhauer on hegel schopenhauer seems to have disliked just about everything concerning his contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel the
following quotation from on the basis of morality page one five one six is quite famous but schopenhauer had good reason to mistrust the writings of hegel in his foreword to the first edition of his work die beiden grundprobleme der ethik schopenhauer had found hegel to have fallen prey to the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy schopenhauer s critique of hegel is most certainly directed at his perception that hegel s works use deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous jargon and neologisms and that they contained castles of abstraction that sounded
impressive but ultimately contained no verifiable content he also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with search for
philosophical truth although schopenhauer may have appeared vain in his constant attacks on hegel they were not necessarily devoid of merit the right hegelians interpreted hegel as seeing the prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all
history up until then common misconceptions many are put off schopenhauer by descriptions of him as an obstinate and arrogant man who did not lead the ascetic
life that he glorified in his work the idea that he made resignation into a command to virtue is inaccurate as he was merely trying to explain asceticism in terms of metaphysics he does refer to the asceticism as a state of inner peace and cheerfulness but he also clearly states that he was not trying to recommend the denial of the will above the affirmation of the will furthermore the call to asceticism was supposed to come to select individuals as knowledge all of
a sudden rather than being a virtue that can be taught in general he wrote it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses the world as will and representation vol i six eight nietzsche seems
to have made this misinterpretation leading some people to a distorted view of schopenhauer the following sentence
from the twilight of the idols is often quoted schopenhauer did see all these things as means to a more peaceful and enlightened way of life but none of them were denial of the will to live only asceticism is referred to in that way nietzsche also claimed that schopenhauer did not recognise that suffering had a redemptive quality yet his recognition of this seems blatantly clear in part four of the world as will and representation also his identification of the will with the kantian thing in
itself has been misunderstood kant defined things in themselves as being beyond comprehension and that no one could know the inner nature of a material thing it is sometimes thought that schopenhauer denied this but he did not what he did assert was that one could know things about the thing in itself for example you can know that the will is a striving force that it is endless that it causes suffering that it will produce boredom if
unoccupied etc however he did not say that you could directly know the will in addition it has sometimes been criticised that he never defined the will but he explained that it could not be fully defined influence schopenhauer is thought to have influenced the following

north and in cabinda the zambezi river and several tributaries of the congo river have their sources in angola the coastal strip is tempered by the cool benguela current resulting in a climate similar to coastal peru or baja california there is a short rainy season lasting from february to april summers are hot and dry while winters are mild the interior highlands have a mild
climate with a rainy season from november through april followed by a cool dry season from may to october elevations generally range from three zero zero zero to six zero zero zero feet nine zero zero to one eight zero zero m the far north and cabinda enjoy rain throughout much of the year
the coast is for the most part flat with occasional low cliffs and bluffs of red sandstone there is but one deep inlet of the sea great fish bay or ba a dos tigres farther north are port alexander little fish bay and lobito bay while shallower bays are numerous lobito bay has water sufficient to allow large ships to unload close inshore the coast plain extends inland for a distance varying from three zero to
one zero zero miles four eight to one six five km this region is in general sparsely watered and somewhat sterile the approach to the great central plateau of africa is marked by a series of irregular terraces this intermediate mountain belt is covered with luxuriant vegetation water is fairly abundant though in the dry season obtainable only by digging in the sandy beds of the rivers the plateau has an altitude ranging from four zero zero zero to
six zero zero zero ft one two zero zero to one eight zero zero m it consists of well watered wide rolling plains and low hills with scanty vegetation in the east the tableland falls away to the basins of the congo
and zambezi to the south it merges into a barren sandy desert a large number of rivers make their way westward to the sea they rise mostly in the mountain belt and are unimportant the only two of

like the okavango drain to lake ngami geology the rock formations of angola are met with in three distinct regions the littoral zone the median zone formed by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast the central plateau the central plateau consists of ancient crystalline rocks with granites overlain by unfossiliferous sandstones and conglomerates of paleozoic age the outcrops are largely hidden under laterite the median zone is
composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks the littoral zone contains the only fossiliferous strata these are of tertiary and cretaceous ages the latter rocks resting on a reddish sandstone of older date the cretaceous rocks of the
dombe grande region near benguella are of albian age and belong to the acanthoceras mamillari zone the beds containing schloenbachia inflata are referable to the gault rocks of tertiary age are met with at dombe grande mossamedes and near loanda the sandstones with gypsum copper and sulfur of dombe are doubtfully considered to be of triassic age recent eruptive rocks mainly basalts form a line of hills almost bare of vegetation between benguella and mossamedes nepheline

climate like the rest of tropical africa angola experiences distinct alternating rainy and dry seasons it is semiarid in south and along coast to luanda north has cool dry season may to october and hot rainy season november to april in the interior above three three zero zero ft one zero zero zero m the temperature and rainfall decrease the plateau climate is healthy and invigorating
the mean annual temperature at s o salvador do congo is two two two c seven two five f at loanda two three three c seven four three f and at caconda one nine five c six seven two f the climate is greatly influenced by the prevailing winds which arc w s w and s s w two seasons are distinguished the cool from june to september and the rainy from october to may the heaviest rainfall occurs in april and is accompanied by violent storms terrain angola has three principal natural regions the coastal lowland
characterized by low plains and terraces hills and mountains rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment and an area of high plains called the high plateau planalto which extends eastward from the escarpment the highest point in angola is morro de moco at two six two zero m coastal lowland the coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces this region varies in width from about two five kilometers near benguela to more than one five zero kilometers in the cuanza river valley just
south of angola s capital luanda and is markedly different from angola s highland mass the atlantic ocean s cold northwardflowing benguela current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast making the region relatively arid or nearly so south of benguela where it forms the northern extension of the namib desert and quite dry even in its northern reaches even where as around
luanda the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters it is not uncommon for the rains to fail given this
pattern of precipitation the far south is marked by sand dunes which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush hills and mountains the belt of hills and mountains parallels the coast at distances ranging from two zero kilometers to one zero zero kilometers inland the cuanza river divides the zone into two parts the northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of five zero zero meters with crests as high as one zero zero zero
meters to one eight zero zero meters south of the cuanza river the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment extending from a point east of luanda and running south through namibia the escarpment reaches two four zero zero meters at its highest point southeast of the town of sumbe and is steepest in the far south in the serra da chela mountain range high plateau the high plateau lies to the east
of the hills and mountains and dominates angola s terrain the surface of the plateau is typically flat or rolling but parts of the benguela plateau and the humpata highland area of the hu la plateau in the south reach heights of two five zero zero meters and more
the malanje plateau to the north rarely exceeds one zero zero zero meters in height the benguela plateau and the coastal area in the immediate environs of benguela and lobito the bi plateau the malanje plateau and a small section of the hu la plateau near the town of lubango have long been among the most densely settled areas in angola
drainage most of the country s many rivers originate in central angola but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied a number of rivers flow in a more
or less westerly course to the atlantic ocean providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power only some of which had been realized by one nine eight eight two of angola s most important rivers the cuanza and the cunene take a more indirect route to the atlantic the cuanza flowing north and the cunene flowing south before turning west the cuanza is the only river wholly within angola that is navigable for nearly two zero zero kilometers from
its mouth by boats of commercially or militarily significant size the congo river whose mouth and western end form a small portion of angola s northern border with zaire is also navigable north of the lunda divide a number of
important tributaries of the congo river flow north to join it draining angola s northeast quadrant south of the
divide some rivers flow into the zambezi river and thence to the indian ocean others to the okavango river as the cubango river is called along the border with namibia and in botswana and thence to the okavango swamp in botswana the tributaries of the cubango river and several of the southern rivers flowing to the atlantic are seasonal completely dry much of the year land use

a massive surprise attack against grant at the battle of shiloh on april six one eight six two as the confederate forces overran the union camps johnston seemed to be everywhere personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line at about two three zero p m while leading one of those charges he was wounded taking a bullet behind his right knee he did not think the wound serious at the time and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded union soldiers instead the bullet
had in fact clipped his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood within a few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off of his horse and asked him if he was wounded to which he replied yes and i fear seriously it is possible that johnston s duel in one eight three seven had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result johnston was taken to a small
ravine where he bled to death in minutes ironically it is probable that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round no union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind johnston during the fatal charge while it is known that many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers he was
the highest ranking casualty of the war and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy jefferson davis considered him the best general in the country this was two months before the emergence of robert e lee as their pre eminent general epitaph johnston was buried in new orleans louisiana in one eight

heats up by stephen leahy oceans seas arctic the android data portrayed by brent spiner from the tv series star trek the next generation an android is an artificially created robot an automaton that resembles a human being usually both in appearance and behavior the word derives from the greek andr meaning man male and the suffix eides used to mean of the species alike from eidos species the
word droid a robot in the star wars universe is derived from this meaning in the semantic sense the word android is a misnomer the intended meaning is an artificial human being like being while the literal translation is an artificial male being the word andros has definite meaning of male human being in greek while the word man can mean either male human being or human being in general the gender neutral word for human being in greek is anthropos and the correct word for an artificial human being like automaton would be anthropoid toc usage and distinctions
unlike the terms robot a mechanical being and cyborg a being that is partly organic and partly mechanical the word android has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of artificially constructed beings a robot that closely resembles a human a cyborg that closely resembles a human an artificially created yet primarily organic being that closely resembles a human although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness
and automata devices that have independence the term android was first used by the french author mathias villiers de l isle adam one eight three eight one eight eight nine in his work tomorrow s eve featuring an artificial human like robot named hadaly as said by the officer in the story in this age of realien advancement who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls although karel apek s robots in
r u r rossum s universal robots one nine two one the play that introduced the word robot to the world were organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings the term android can mean either one of these while a cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be a creature that is
a combination of organic and mechanical parts ambiguity historically science fiction authors have used android in a greater diversity of ways than the terms robot and cyborg in some fiction works the primary difference between a robot and android is only skin deep with androids being made to look almost exactly like humans on the outside but with
internal mechanics exactly the same as that of robots in other stories authors have defined
android to indicate a wholly organic yet artificial creation other definitions of android fall somewhere in between the character data from the television series star trek the next generation is described as an android data became intoxicated in an early episode the naked now and is later referred to having bioplast sheeting for skin the most toys perhaps suggesting that he was initially intended by the writers to be at least partially organic otherwise data was shown to be mechanical throughout and this often
became a central plot theme the replicants from the movie blade runner were bioengineered organic beings while they were not referred to as either robots or androids in the movie the screenplay was originally based on a novel by philip
k dick called do androids dream of electric sheep in the video game beneath a steel sky genetically engineered androids similar to blade runner s replicants are a central plot theme however despite their organic
makeup their behavior is programmed by computer the robots of apek s r u r were organic in nature today an author writing a similar story might very well be inclined to call them androids the character ash in the movie alien another artificial organic being is often referred to as an android though not in the dialogue of the movie itself similarly the character bishop in aliens and alien is a more advanced android commonly called a synthetic but prefers to be called an
artificial person much later in the series timeline the character call in alien resurrection is ashamed of being an android c three po and r two d two from the star wars movies are referred to as droids while c three po could reasonably be called an android because he is humanoid in appearance the squat cylinder r two d two is only humanoid in behavior in the movie a i the robotic characters are called
mechanoids but the film is loosely based on a short story written by brian aldiss called supertoys last all summer long in which the central character david is called an android by which aldiss seemed to be referring to an organic creation in the anime manga chobits androids are known as persicoms essentially computers in a man made body the series does not go into their internal composition but it is assumed to be artificial with a very realistic outside one of the key points of this series was a special type of persicom named
a chobit a persicom that had free will and the ability to fall in love and have emotions androids in fiction thus far androids have remained mostly within the domain of science fiction and frequently in film and television however some humanoid robots exist one of the earliest android characters is otho
from the captain future stories of edmond hamilton otho s construction is never discussed but he is much more human like than his companion grag a mechanical robot isaac asimov s robot stories are mostly about androids many are collected in i robot one nine five zero they promulgated a set of rules of ethics for androids and robots see three laws of robotics that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject most of asimov s robots appear too artificial to be mistaken for human beings with the notable exceptions of

alberta extends for one two zero zero km from north to south and about six zero zero km wide at its greatest east west extent it is natural that
the climate should vary considerably between the four nine th and six zero th parallels it is also further influenced by altitude especially in the southwestern part of the province within the canadian rockies and adjacent areas directly to the east banff national park northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has fewer frost free days than southern alberta which is often semi arid due to the summer heat and much lower rainfall western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the warmth brought by winter chinook winds while southeastern alberta is flat

the rest of the world estimated to be one six trillion barrels two five four km with the advancement of extraction methods bitumen and economical synthetic crude are produced at costs nearing that of conventional crude this technology is alberta grown and developed many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non conventional methods to extract the bitumen from the athabasca deposit with current technology only three one five billion barrels five zero km are recoverable fort mcmurray one of
canada s youngest and liveliest cities has grown up entirely because of the large multinational corporations which have taken on the task of oil production another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the tar sands is the price of oil in two zero zero
five record oil prices have made it more than profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss while edmonton is considered the pipeline junction manufacturing chemical processing research and refining centre of the province calgary is known for its senior and junior oil company head offices unlike edmonton calgary is not close to any large sources of oil with
concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high tech industries have found their birth in alberta notably the invention and perfection of liquid crystal display systems with a growing economy alberta has several financial institutions dealing
with several civil and private funds agriculture and forestry farm buildings alberta canola field grain elevator alberta agriculture has a significant position in the province s economy over five million cattle are residents of the province at one time or another and alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta alberta is
one of the prime producers of plains buffalo bison for
the consumer market sheep for wool and mutton are also raised wheat and canola are primary farm crops with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production with other grains also prominent much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation continuous cropping in which there is no
fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil
erosion across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees
to produce honey from clover and fireweed hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need the vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow alberta to produce large quantities of lumber and plywood and several northern alberta plants supply north america and the pacific rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint government see also politics of alberta edmonton is the seat of government of alberta it is a parliamentary democracy its unicameral legislature the legislative assembly consists of eight three members
as canada s head of state queen elizabeth ii is the government of alberta s chief executive her duties in alberta are carried out by lieutenant governor norman kwong the government is headed by the premier ralph klein the city of edmonton is alberta s government capital the province
s revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil natural gas beef softwood lumber and wheat but also includes grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects albertans are the lowest taxed people in canada and alberta is the only province in canada without a provincial sales
tax though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax the gst alberta s municipalities have their own governments which usually work in co operation with the provincial government alberta s politics are much more conservative than those of other canadian provinces alberta has traditionally had three political parties the progressive conservatives conservatives or tories the centrist liberals and the social democratic new democrats a fourth party the strongly conservative social credit party was a power in alberta for many decades but fell from the political
map after the progressive conservatives came to power in the early one nine seven zero s since that time no other political party has governed alberta in fact only three parties have governed alberta the united farmers of alberta the social credit party and the currently governing progressive conservative party as is the case with many western canadian provinces alberta has had occasional bouts of separatist sentiment even during the one nine eight zero s when these feelings were at their strongest there has never been enough interest in secession to
initiate any major movements or referenda there are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of alberta in some form currently active in the province see also alberta separatism in the two zero zero four provincial election held in november the alberta alliance party running to the right wing politics of the conservatives won one seat see also list of alberta premiers list of alberta general elections education as with any canadian province the alberta government is the
highest authority in education creating and regulating the school boards public colleges universities and other educational institutions k one two the vast majority of alberta s schools are run by publicly funded school boards each with its own district of authority the largest are english language public school boards alberta also has english separate catholic boards throughout the province which serve a substantial minority of students there is one protestant school board
in part of the province where numbers warrant there are
francophone school boards public and separate catholic all five of these types of boards are primarily publicly funded basic school fees range from two zero zero seven five zero depending on the school board by local property taxes and provincial grants given on an equal per student basis by the province with some adjustments the different types of school boards are a necessity under the canadian constitution which guarantees the francophones and catholic communities both the right to their own schools and the right to administer them
some other canadian provinces have reformed their school systems on non religious lines by seeking a constitutional amendment but alberta has not often the decision to go to one system or another is not based on religion
but a parent s belief of which system provides a better education starting in one nine nine four the province has allowed some chartered schools to operate independently of any district school board reporting directly to the province homeschooling is
officially recognized and partially funded from within the alberta school system originally in alberta school boards had the power to levy property taxes within their respective districts however this meant districts with a low tax base were underfunded so the province moved to a system that pools the education property tax and distributes it based on student population and need post secondary alberta s oldest and largest university is edmonton s university of alberta the university of calgary once affiliated
with the university of alberta gained its autonomy in one nine six six and is now the second largest university in alberta there is also athabasca university which focuses on distance learning and the university of lethbridge there are one five colleges that receive direct public funding along with two technical institutes nait and sait students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions transportation alberta

at lethbridge highway three joins lethbridge to fort macleod and links highway four to highway two highway two travels northward through fort macleod calgary red deer and edmonton before dividing into two highways one continues northwest as highway four three into grande prairie and the peace river country the other highway six three travels northeast to fort mcmurray the location of the athabasca oil sands highway two is supplimented by two more highways that run parallel to it highway two two west of highway two known as the cowboy trail and highway two one east
of highway two alberta has two main east west corridors the southern corridor part of the trans canada highway system enters the province near medicine hat runs westward
through calgary and leaves alberta through banff national park the northern corridor also part of the trans canada network but known alternatively as the yellowhead highway highway one six runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia on a sunny spring or fall day one of the most scenic drives in the world is along the icefields parkway which runs some three zero zero km between jasper and banff with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length urban stretches of alberta s major highways and freeways are often
called trails for example highway two is deerfoot trail as it passes through calgary calgary trail as it leaves edmonton southbound and st albert trail as it leaves edmonton northbound toward the city of st albert visitors from outside alberta often find this disconcerting accustomed as they are to the notion that a trail is
an unpaved route primarily for pedestrians edmonton calgary red deer medicine hat and lethbridge have substantial mass transit systems edmonton and calgary also operate light rail vehicles alberta is well connected by air with international airports at both edmonton and calgary calgary s airport is the larger of the two and is also the fourth busiest in canada it is a hub airport for a significant proportion of the connecting trans border and international flights into and out of central canada there

also makes a visit to tourist attractions like banff national park something which can easily be done in a day calgary and banff each host nearly five million tourists yearly alberta is an important destination for tourists who
love to ski and hike alberta boasts several world class ski resorts hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive trophies and tall tales from their experiences
in alberta s wilderness demographics alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years due in large part to its burgeoning economy between two zero zero three and

also has the second highest percentage of non religious residents in canada after british columbia the mormons of alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province there are temples in both cardston and edmonton many alberta mormons descend from mormon pioneers who emigrated from utah around the turn of the two zero th century alberta also has a large hutterite population
a communal anabaptist sect similar to the mennonites and a significant
population of seventh day adventists in and around the lacombe area due to the presence of the canadian university college many people of the hindu sikh and muslim faiths also make alberta their home one of the largest sikh temples in canada is located just outside of edmonton religion protestant three eight nine roman catholic two six seven no affiliation two three six christian orthodox one five other christian four one muslim one five buddhist one one history main
article history of alberta the present province of alberta as far north as about five three north latitude was a part of rupert s land from the time of the incorporation of the hudson s bay company one six seven zero after the arrival in the north west of the french around one
seven three one they settled the prairies of the west establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonqui re was established near what is now calgary in
one seven five two the north west company of montreal occupied the northern part of alberta territory before the hudson s bay company arrived from hudson bay to take possession of it the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who on behalf of the north west company of montreal built fort athabasca on lac la biche in one seven seven eight roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in one seven eight eight his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then
setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name the mackenzie river which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so being the first white man to cross the north american continent north of mexico the district of alberta was
created as part of the north west territories in one eight eight two as settlement increased local representatives to the north west legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in one nine zero five the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status fauna and flora fauna the three climatic regions alpine
forest and prairie of alberta are home to many different species of animals the south and central prairie was the land of the bison its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback and thrive on farms and in parks all over alberta alberta is home to many large carnivores among them are the grizzly
and black bears which are found in the mountains and wooded regions smaller carnivores of the dog and cat families include coyotes wolves fox
lynx bobcat and mountain lion cougar rocky mountains bighorn sheep herbivorous or plant eating animals are found throughout the province moose and deer both mule and white tail varieties are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn antelope can be found in the prairies of southern alberta bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live
in every corner of the province alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake the prairie rattlesnake central and northern alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of the migratory birds vast numbers of ducks geese swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta
eagles hawks owls and crows are plentiful and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect eating birds can be found alberta like other temperate regions is home to mosquitoes flies wasps and bees rivers and lakes are well stocked with pike walleye white fish rainbow speckled and brown trout and even sturgeon turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians
that make their homes in alberta flora in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie anemone the avens crocuses and other early flowers the advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family until in august the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple the southern part of alberta is covered by a short grass very nutritive but dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the buffalo bean fleabane and sage
both yellow and purple clover fill the roadways and the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides these are largely deciduous typically birch poplar and tamarack many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain on the north side of the north saskatchewan river evergreen

the arctic circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the earth this is the parallel of latitude that in two zero zero zero runs six six three three three nine north of the equator everything north of this circle is known as the arctic and the zone just to the south of this circle is the northern temperate zone the arctic circle marks the southern extremity of the polar day of the summer solstice in june and
the polar night of the winter solstice in december within the arctic circle the arctic sun is above the horizon for at least two four continuous hours once per year in conjunction with the arctic s summer solstice this is often
referred to in local as midnight sun likewise in conjunction with the arctic s winter solstice the arctic sun will be below the horizon for at least two four continuous hours in fact because of refraction and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point part of the midnight sun may be seen at the night of the summer solstice up to about five zero nine zero km south of the geometric arctic circle similarly at the day of the winter solstice part of the
sun may be seen up to about five zero north of the geometric arctic circle this is true at sea level these limits increase with elevation above sea level however in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the horizon the position of the arctic circle is determined by the axial tilt angle of the polar axis of rotation of the earth on the ecliptic this angle is not
constant but has a complex motion determined by many cycles of short to very long periods due to nutation the tilt oscillates over nine about two eight zero m on the surface over a period of one eight six years the main long term cycle has a period of four one zero zero zero years and an amplitude of about zero six eight or seven six km on the surface currently
the tilt is decreasing by about zero four seven per year so the arctic circle is moving north by about one
four m per year also see precession countries which have significant territory within the arctic circle are russia canada denmark greenland united states of america alaska norway sweden finland the country of iceland also has territory within the arctic circle but less than one sq km this area is on a few small islets of which only gr msey which lies directly on the arctic circle is inhabited see also antarctic circle circumpolar arctic external links santa s lapland and christmas club lapland and arctic circle topographical map of arctic circle centered about

selective fire rifle or carbine depending on the particular firearm s size using intermediate powered ammunition they are categorized between the larger and heavier light machine gun and the weaker submachine gun assault rifles are the standard small arm in most modern armies having
largely replaced or suplemented the larger more powerful rifles of the past the name is a literal translation of the german term sturmgewehr or storm weapon first applied to the sturmgewehr four four developed during world war ii it gradually became a popular term for this type
of firearm the term has since been retro actively applied to earlier weapons with similar traits history one nine zero zero s to the one nine three zero s light automatic rifles using rifle cartridges federov avtomat russia the weapon fired the japanese rifle cartridge these automatic firearms tended to use
used pre existing rifle cartridges kinetic energy ranged between three zero zero zero five zero zero zero j two two zero zero three seven zero zero foot pounds velocites of seven five zero nine zero zero m s two four six zero two nine five zero ft s and bullets of nine to one three g one three nine two zero zero grains the first
true assault rifle was probably the italian made cei rigotti which was developed in the one eight nine zero s and finished around one nine zero zero at the beginning of the two zero th century it never entered military service however the first service assault rifle was the russian federov avtomat of one nine one six chambered for the japanese arisaka six five five zero mm rifle cartridge which was only used in small numbers due to supply problems the browning automatic rifle bar was a world
war i era weapon that used a full power round it was an automatic rifle by today s definition and designed for single accurate shots and suppressive automatic fire the weight of roughly one five pounds seven kg meant that it was rather cumbersome for closer quarters later developments added heavier barrels and bipods that lent it to being used as more like today s light machine gun or squad automatic weapon though it did help establish the doctrine of use
for light selective fire rifles the bar was produced in large numbers widely adopted and served into the one nine six zero s with the u s military and other nations while it did not use an intermediate cartridge it was an intermediate weapon between the newly adopted submachine guns and heavier machine guns such as the lewis gun during wwi a few weaker submachine guns also
entered service such as the villar perosa the berretta one nine one eight and the mp one eight these weapons fired rounds based of pistols nine mm glisenti and nine mm bergmann the nine mm bergman was based on the nine mm parabellum with reduced charge to reduce recoil in the mp one eight the developers of the thompson submachine gun also developed during the one nine one zero s originally intended to use rifle powered rounds however a mechanical system that could
handle their power was not found and it ended up using the four five acp cartridge these firearms are considered part of
the submachine gun class but were an important part in the development of the assault rifles one nine three zero s automatic intermediate weapons some of these automatic and semi automatic firearms used new intermediate cartridges others used pre existing rounds an attempt to provide soldiers with a rifle with intermediate power ammunition that was heavier than a submachine gun too weak with short range due to the
pistol ammunition but lighter than a long rifle uncomfortable to fire and difficult to control on fully automatic mode due to the powerful ammunition more expensive to
design and manufacture by the italian arms company beretta resulted in the mab three eight moschetto automatico beretta one nine three eight the mab three eight used a fiocchi nine m three eight cartridge and a higher powered nine mm parabellum cartridge which could provide longer range fire the effective range was about two zero zero m although it was declared to be effective up to five zero zero m
the mab three eight was a multipurpose weapon m one carbine u s unlike the m one the later m two and m three were fully automatic in one nine three eight prior to world war ii the united states introduced the m one carbine which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the three zero carbine cartridge the m one carbine was
originally planned to have automatic fire but this was dropped from the first version although later in the war selective fire variants were made m two and m three carbines the weapon had higher stopping power than submachine guns but was not as powerful as full size automatic rifles such as the bar the longer barrel one eight inch provided the carbine with higher muzzle velocity than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same three
zero round the m one carbine series was designed for close quarters engagements a concept that would be re applied later it marked the first time in which such an
intermediate weapon would be mass produced in such large numbers it became the most produced american weapon of the war
with millions made the m one carbine series would remain in service with the u s military until replaced by the m one six rifle in the one nine six zero s it continued to be used in other nations one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s
maschinenkarabiner sturmgewehr others used new intermediate cartridges kinetic energy ranged between one four zero zero two one zero zero j one zero three three one five five zero foot pounds muzzle velocities of six zero zero eight zero zero m s one nine seven zero two six two five ft s and bullets of seven
nine g one zero eight one three nine grains germany like other countries had studied the problem since world war i and
their factories made a variety of non standard cartridges therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers the seven nine two three zero mm cartridge was an example of these experiments in one nine four one it was improved to seven nine two three three mm infanterie kurz patrone infantry short standard in one nine four two it was again improved as maschinenkarabiner patrone s and
in one nine four three pistolen patrone four three me then finally infanterie kurz patrone four three it is just a coincidence but the intermediate cartridge developed by winchester for the m one carbine developed slightly before also measured three three mm in one nine four two walther presented the maschinenkarabiner automatic carbine
abbr mkb named mkb four two w in the same year haenel presented the mkb four two h designed by hugo schmeisser as a result of this program rheinmetall borsig some said krieghoff presented its fg four two fallschirmjaeger gewehr four two sponsored by hermann
g ring though this was in a different role and using a heavy eight five seven mm eight mm mauser cartridge which was not an intermediate round war time
tests in russia indicated the mkb four two h performed better than the other two schmeisser developed it first as the mp four
three then mp four three one and finally as the mp four four sturmgewehr four four abbreviated stg four four it immediately entered large scale production more than five zero zero zero units had been produced by february one nine four four and five five zero zero zero by the following november following the end of the war the soviet union developed the ak four seven which was vaguely similar in concept and layout to the german stg four four but extremely different mechanically it fired the seven six
two three nine mm cartridge which had been developed during wwii the round was similar to the stg four four s in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the russian rifle ammunition one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s lighter automatic weapons and lighter smaller bullets many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and
smaller calibers but fired at very high velocity kinetic energy
ranged between one three zero zero one eight zero zero j nine six zero one three three zero foot pounds velocities of nine zero zero one zero five zero m s two nine five zero three four five zero ft s and bullets of three four g four six six two grains sig five five zero
swiss the sig fires gw pat nine zero which has the same caliber as the five five six mm nato many nations continued the development of traditional high powered rifles with ranges of five zero zero meters five five zero yards and beyond most designs of this period used low caliber but high velocity ammunition with some experiments in
flechettes and other exotic ammunition statistical studies of world war ii battles performed by the u s army revealed that infantry combat beyond three zero zero meters three two five yards was rare the russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman s ability to aim therefore a lighter less powerful cartridge could be effective this permitted a lighter rifle and enabled troops to carry more ammunition making them
more autonomous a greater amount of the lighter ammunition could be transported in the same amount of space in addition the smaller size and handiness of
an assault rifle would benefit tank crews support troops and units with missions other than front line combat the five five six four five mm nato cartridge was developed in the one nine six zero s and was adopted for use in the m one six assault rifle the m one six a one version soon followed and was then replaced
in one nine eight two by the m one six a two the soviet union also developed its own similar round the five four five three nine mm which was used in the ak seven four the successor of
the ak four seven these rounds are usually considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds that fired larger rifle caliber ammunition with reduced propellant
but the smaller caliber and lighter bullets achieve higher velocities than even a hunting
rifle bullet these high speeds induce additional lethality through bullet shattering although these high speed rounds generally do not exceed the momentum of the heavier but slower bullets of the less sophisticated ak four seven any pointed spitzer round will tumble in soft tissue if the jacket has a cannelure like the u s five five six four five mm m one nine three round the bullet will fragment leading to significant blood loss and internal damage blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue since combat use of rifles expends
around five zero zero zero zero rounds in suppressive fire for each combatant killed trading lighter cartridge weight and lower recoil for slower but more sure incapacitation often makes good sense
the key to the assault rifle concept is firing at both known and suspected enemy positions this allows an attacking infantry unit to shoot at a hidden enemy first rather than waiting for the enemy to fire first good volume and distribution of aimed suppressive fire delivered by infantry squad members as they maneuver prevents enemy return fire and in turn allows the assaulting unit to maneuver through enemy fields of fire
faster faster maneuver limits the assaulting unit s vulnerability to small arms fire artillery mortars or counter attack of course this requires a larger basic ammunition load and steady supply of rifle ammunition one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s one nine nine zero s new form factors and features many of these automatic firearms usually used the same rounds as in older eras but focused on using new form factors materials and added features
like standard telescopic and reflex sights famas france it was adopted in one nine seven eight the biggest change since adoption of high velocity rounds of five mm caliber and higher has been designs that have new form factors sights electronics and materials a number of bullpup rifles entered service in
the late one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s although bullpup rifles had existed since the one nine three zero s the united kingdom s em two was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time examples of the new trend include the famas steyr aug and sa eight zero they were all bullpup rifles that made heavy use of composites and plastics with ambidextrous controls and the latter
both added a low power telescopic sight to the standard service version the sar two one the tavor tar two one and qbz nine five follow a similar trend as well with a bullpup
configuration and heavy use of composites the heckler seven mm range with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber faster modern rounds and the standard caliber slower rounds of the previous generation china in the late one nine eight zero s introduced a five eight four two mm round with an initial velocity of nine three zero m s four two six g
bullet and one eight four two j of energy china claims the new round provides superior performace and lethality to the nato and modern soviet intermediate rounds in the united states remington has developed the six eight mm remington spc cartridge which is the same overall length at
the five five six x four five mm nato round but fires a bullet the same caliber at the two seven zero winchester hunting cartridge its similar
size to the five five six four five mm means that existing rifles can be converted without an excessive amount of trouble development of a four seven three mm caseless ammunition and advanced assault rifle in the one nine seven zero one nine eight zero s by germany was effectively halted by the german reunification in one nine nine zero and that rifle never entered full production assault weapons vs fully automatic weapons primarily in the
united states the term assault weapon is an arbitrary and politicized phrase generally used to describe a collection of semi automatic firearms that have
certain features associated with military police use such as a folding stock flash suppressor bayonet protruding
pistol grip or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of a capacity larger than ten rounds the phrase assault weapon has been used primarily in relation to a specific expired gun law that was commonly known as the assault weapons ban clinton gun ban or one nine nine four crime bill it is a common misconception that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully automatic fire such as assault rifles and machine guns fully automatic weapons were
unaffected by the ban because they have been heavily restricted since the national firearms act of one nine three four and other more recent laws the term assault weapon has often been erroneously used to describe machine guns many states and localities still use the term assault weapon with a variety of variations following the california model loosely see separate article on assault weapons for further information see also automatic firearm for

list of firearms external links assault rifles and their ammunition history and prospects rifles assault rifles animals are a major group of organisms classified as the kingdom animalia or metazoa in general they are multicellular capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment and feed by consuming other organisms their body plan becomes fixed as
they develop usually early on in their development as embryos although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on the name animal comes from the latin word animal of which animalia is the plural and ultimately from
anima meaning vital breath or soul characteristics kingdom animalia has several characteristics that set it
apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and multicellular which separates them from bacteria and most protists they are heterotrophic generally digesting food in an internal chamber which separates them from plants and algae they are also distinguished from plants algae and fungi by lacking cell walls structure with a few exceptions most notably the sponges phylum porifera animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues these include muscles which are able to contract and control locomotion and a nervous system which sends and processes signals there is also typically an internal digestive chamber
with one or two openings animals with this sort of organization are called metazoans or eumetazoans when the former is used for animals in general all animals have eukaryotic cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins this may be calcified to form structures like shells bones and spicules during development it forms a relatively flexible framework upon
which cells can move about and be reorganized making complex structures possible in contrast other multicellular organisms like plants and fungi have cells held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth also unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes reproduction and development nearly all animals undergo some form of sexual reproduction adults are diploid or occasionally polyploid they have a few specialized reproductive cells which undergo meiosis to produce smaller motile spermatozoa or larger non motile
ova these fuse to form zygotes which develop into new individuals many animals are also capable of asexual reproduction this may take place through parthenogenesis where fertile eggs are produced without mating or in some cases through fragmentation a zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called a blastula which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation in sponges blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a
new sponge in most other groups the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement it first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers
an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm in most cases a mesoderm also develops between them these germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs animals grow by indirectly using the energy of sunlight plants use this energy to turn air into simple sugars using a process known as photosynthesis these sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow when animals eat these plants or eat other animals which have eaten plants the sugars produced by the plant are used by the animal they are either
used directly to help the animal grow or broken down releasing stored solar energy and giving the animal the energy required for motion this process is known as glycolysis origin and fossil record animals are generally considered to have evolved from flagellate protozoa their closest living relatives are the choanoflagellates collared flagellates that have the same structure as certain sponge cells do molecular studies place them in a supergroup called the opisthokonts which also include the fungi
and a few small parasitic protists the name comes from the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells such as most animal sperm whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella the first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the precambrian around six zero zero million years ago and are known as the vendian biota these are difficult to relate to later fossils however some may represent precursors of modern phyla but they may be separate groups and it is possible they are not really animals at all aside from them most
known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during the cambrian period about five seven zero million years ago it is still disputed whether this event called the cambrian explosion represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible groups of animals elephant ear sponge the sponges porifera diverged from other animals early as mentioned they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla their cells are differentiated but not organized into distinct tissues sponges are sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through pores archaeocyatha which have
fused skeletons may represent sponges or a separate phylum brain coral among the eumetazoan phyla two are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening which serves as both the mouth and the anus these are the cnidaria which include sea anemones corals and jellyfish and the ctenophora or comb jellies both have distinct tissues but they are not organized into organs there are only two main germ layers
the ectoderm and endoderm with only scattered cells between them as such these animals are sometimes called diploblastic the tiny phylum placozoa is similar but individuals do not have a permanent digestive chamber the remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the bilateria for the most part they are bilaterally symmetric and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs the body is triploblastic i e all three germ layers are well developed and tissues form distinct organs the
digestive chamber has two openings a mouth and an anus and there
is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom there are exceptions to each of these characteristics however for instance adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures clownfish in their sea anemone home genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within the bilateria most appear to belong to four major lineages deuterostomes ecdysozoa platyzoa lophotrochozoa in addition to these
there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to have diverged before these major groups these include the acoelomorpha rhombozoa and orthonectida the myxozoa single celled parasites that were originally considered protozoa are now believed to have developed from the bilateria as well the magellanic penguin deuterostomes deuterostomes differ from the other bilateria called protostomes in several ways in both cases there is a complete digestive tract however in protostomes the initial opening the archenteron
develops into the mouth and an anus forms separately in deuterostomes this is reversed in most protostomes cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm called schizocoelous development but in deuterostomes it forms through invagination of the endoderm called enterocoelic pouching deuterostomes also have a dorsal rather than
a ventral nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage all this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate monophyletic lineages the main phyla of deuterostomes are the echinodermata and chordata the former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine such as sea stars sea urchins and sea cucumbers the latter are dominated by the vertebrates animals with backbones these include
fish amphibians reptiles birds and mammals in addition to these the deuterostomes also include the hemichordata or acorn worms although they are not especially prominent today the important fossil graptolites may belong to this group the chaetognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes but this is less certain ecdysozoa the yellow winged darter the ecdysozoa are protostomes named after the common trait of growth by moulting or ecdysis the largest animal phylum belongs here the
arthropoda including insects spiders crabs and their kin all these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments typically with paired appendages two smaller phyla the onychophora and tardigrada are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits roundworm the ecdysozoans also include the nematoda or roundworms the second largest animal phylum roundworms are typically microscopic and occur in nearly every environment where there is water a number are important parasites smaller phyla related to them are the nematomorpha or horsehair worms which are
visible to the unaided eye and the kinorhyncha priapulida and loricifera which are all microscopic these groups
have a reduced coelom called a pseudocoelom the remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the spiralia since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage bedford s flatworm platyzoa the platyzoa include the phylum platyhelminthes the flatworms these were originally considered some of the most primitive bilateria but it now appears they developed from more
complex ancestors rotifer a number of parasites are included in this group such as the flukes and tapeworms flatworms lack a coelom as do their closest relatives the microscopic gastrotricha the other platyzoan phyla are microscopic and pseudocoelomate the most prominent are the rotifera or rotifers which are common in aqueous environments they also include the acanthocephala or spiny headed worms the gnathostomulida micrognathozoa and possibly the cycliophora these groups share the presence of complex jaws from which they are called the gnathifera lophotrochozoa big blue octopus the lophotrochozoa include two
of the most successful animal phyla the mollusca and annelida the former includes animals such as snails clams and squids and the latter comprises the segmented
worms such as earthworms and leeches these two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of
trochophore larvae but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented now this is generally considered convergent evolution owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla the lophotrochozoa also include the nemertea or ribbon worms the sipuncula and several phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth called a lophophore these were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates but it now appears they are paraphyletic some closer to the nemertea and some to the mollusca and annelida they include the
brachiopoda or lamp shells which are prominent in the fossil record the entoprocta the phoronida and possibly the bryozoa or moss animals history of classification white s tree frog vulpes vulpes the red fox aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants and this was followed by carolus linnaeus in the first hierarchical classification since then biologists have
begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships and so these groups have been restricted somewhat for instance microscopic protozoa were originally considered animals because they move but are now treated separately in
linnaeus original scheme the animals were one of three kingdoms divided into the classes
of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum the chordata whereas the various other forms have been separated out the above lists represent our current understanding of the group though there is some variation from source to source usage of the word
animal in everyday usage animal refers to any member of the animal kingdom that is not a
human being and sometimes excludes insects although including such arthropods as crabs this confusion stems primarily from the familiarity with zoo animals farm animals and pets not from an analytical distinction between insects humans and the rest of the animal kingdom examples some well known types of animals listed by their

one nine four seven albert einstein march one four one eight seven nine april one eight one nine five five was a german born theoretical physicist widely regarded as the greatest scientist of the two
zero th century he was the author of the general theory of relativity and made important contributions to the special theory of relativity quantum mechanics statistical mechanics and cosmology he was awarded the one nine two one nobel prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect in one nine zero five his miracle year and for his services to theoretical physics after british solar eclipse expeditions in one nine one nine confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in the exact amount he predicted in his general theory of
relativity einstein became world famous an unusual achievement for a scientist in his later years his fame exceeded that of any other scientist in history in popular culture his name has become synonymous with great intelligence and genius biography young einstein before the einsteins moved from germany to italy youth and college einstein was born on march one four one eight seven nine at ulm in baden w rttemberg german empire about one zero zero km east of stuttgart his parents were hermann einstein a featherbed salesman who later ran an electrochemical
works and pauline whose maiden name was koch they were married in stuttgart bad cannstatt the family was jewish non observant albert attended a catholic elementary school and at the insistence of his mother was given violin lessons though he initially disliked and eventually discontinued the lessons he would later take great solace in mozart s violin sonatas when albert was five his father showed him a pocket compass and einstein realized that something in empty space acted upon the needle he would later describe the experience as one of the
most revelatory of his life though he built models and mechanical devices for fun and showed great mathematical faculty early on he was considered a slow learner possibly due to dyslexia simple shyness or the significantly rare and unusual structure of his brain examined after his death he later credited his
development of the theory of relativity to this slowness saying that by pondering space and time later than most children he was able to apply a more developed intellect some researchers have speculated that einstein may have exhibited some traits of mild forms of autism although they concede that a reliable posthumous diagnosis is impossible in one eight eight nine a student named max talmud introduced einstein to key science and philosophy texts including kant
s critique of pure reason two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by suggesting and providing books on science mathematics and philosophy einstein attended the luitpold gymnasium where he received a relatively progressive education he began to learn mathematics around age twelve in one eight nine one he taught himself euclidean plane geometry from
a school booklet and began to study calculus there is a recurring rumor that he failed mathematics later in his education but this is untrue a change in the way grades were assigned caused confusion years later while there he clashed with authority and resented
the school regimen believing the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such an endeavor as strict memorization in one eight nine four following the failure of hermann s electrochemical business the einsteins moved from munich to pavia italy near milan einstein s first scientific work was written therein called the investigation of the state of aether in magnetic fields albert remained behind
in munich lodgings to finish school completing only one term before leaving the gymnasium in spring one eight nine five to rejoin his family in pavia he quit without telling his parents
and a year and a half prior to final examinations einstein convinced the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor but this meant he had no secondary school certificate that
year at the age of one six he performed the thought experiment known as albert
einstein s mirror after gazing into a mirror he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the speed of light his conclusion that the
speed of light is independent of the observer would later become one of the two postulates of special relativity despite excelling in the mathematics and science portion his failure of the liberal arts portion of the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth swiss federal institute of technology in zurich entrance exam the following year was a setback his family sent him to aarau switzerland to finish secondary school where he studied the seldom taught maxwell s electromagnetic theory and received his diploma in september one eight nine six during this
time he lodged with professor jost winteler s family and became enamoured with marie their daughter his first sweetheart albert s sister maja was to later marry their son
paul and his friend michele besso married their other daughter anna einstein subsequently enrolled at the eidgen ssische technische hochschule in october and moved to
zurich while marie moved to olsberg for a teaching post the same year he renounced his w rttemberg citizenship and became stateless in
the spring of one eight nine six the serbian mileva mari started initially as a medical student at the university of zurich but after
a term switched to the same section as einstein as the only woman that year to study for the same diploma einstein s relationship with mileva developed into romance over the next few years in one nine zero zero he was granted
a teaching diploma by the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth zurich einstein then wrote his first published paper on the capillary forces of a drinking straw wherein he tried to unify the laws of physics an attempt he would continually make throughout his life it was titled folgerungen aus den capillarit tserscheinungen which translated is consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena found in annalen der physik volume four page five one three shortly following einstein was accepted as a swiss citizen in one nine zero one he kept his swiss passport for his whole life through
his friend michelle besso an engineer he was presented with the works of ernst mach and later would consider him the best sounding board in europe for physical ideas during this time einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends including besso and mileva the men referred to themselves as the olympia academy he and mileva had an illegitimate
daughter lieserl born in january one nine zero two work and doctorate einstein in one nine zero five when he wrote the annus mirabilis papers upon graduation einstein could not find a teaching post mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most
of his professors the father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant examiner at the swiss
patent office in one nine zero two there einstein judged the worth of inventors patent applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand in particular he was chiefly charged to
evaluate patents relating to electromagnetic devices he also learned how to
discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions and was taught by the director how to express himself correctly he occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work einstein married mileva mari on january six one nine zero three einstein s marriage to mari who was a mathematician was both a personal and intellectual partnership einstein referred to mileva as a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as i am ronald w clark a biographer
of einstein claimed that einstein depended on the distance that existed in
his and mileva s marriage in order to have the
solitude necessary to accomplish his work he required intellectual isolation abram joffe a soviet physicist who knew einstein in an obituary of einstein wrote the author of the papers of one nine zero five was a bureaucrat at the patent office in bern einstein mari and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship however according to alberto a mart nez of the center for einstein studies at boston university joffe only ascribed authorship to einstein as he believed that it was a swiss custom
at the time to append the spouse s last name to the husband s name whatever the truth the extent of her influence on einstein s work is a highly
controversial and debated question on may one four one nine zero four the couple s first son hans albert einstein was born in one nine zero three einstein s position at the swiss patent office had been made permanent though he was passed over
for promotion until he had fully mastered machine technology he obtained his doctorate after submitting his thesis a
new determination of molecular dimensions eine neue bestimmung der molek ldimensionen in one nine zero five that same year he wrote four
articles that provided the foundation of modern physics without much scientific literature to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories most physicists agree that three of those papers on
brownian motion the photoelectric effect and special relativity deserved nobel prizes only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the nobel committee in the award this
is ironic not only because einstein is far better known for relativity but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon and einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path quantum theory would take in each of these papers einstein boldly took an idea from theoretical physics to its logical consequences and managed to explain experimental results that had baffled scientists for decades max planck and einstein annus mirabilis papers einstein submitted the series of papers to the
annalen der physik they are commonly referred to as the annus mirabilis papers from annus mirabilis latin for year of wonders the international union of pure and applied physics iupap commemorated the one zero zero th year of the publication of einstein s extensive work in one nine zero five as the world year of physics two zero zero five the first paper named on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light ber einen die erzeugung und verwandlung des lichtes betreffenden heuristischen gesichtspunkt proposed that energy quanta which are essentially what
we now call photons were real and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect this paper was specifically cited for his nobel prize max planck had
made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black body radiation law published in one nine zero one but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick the photoelectric effect thus provided a simple confirmation of max planck s hypothesis of quanta his second article in one nine zero five named on the motion required by the
molecular kinetic theory of heat of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid ber die von der molekularkinetischen theorie der w
rme geforderte bewegung von in ruhenden fl ssigkeiten suspendierten teilchen covered his study of brownian motion and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms before this paper atoms were recognized as a useful concept but physicists and chemists hotly debated whether atoms were real entities einstein s statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope wilhelm ostwald one
of the leaders of the anti atom school later told arnold sommerfeld that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by einstein s complete explanation of brownian motion at the same time as einstein brownian motion was also described by smoluchowski einstein s third paper that year on the electrodynamics of moving bodies zur elektrodynamik bewegter k rper was published in september one nine zero five this
paper introduced the special theory of relativity a theory of time distance mass and energy which was consistent with electromagnetism but omitted the force of gravity while developing this paper einstein wrote to mileva about our work on relative motion and this has led some to ask whether mileva played a part in its development a few historians of science believe that einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous frenchman henri poincar had already published the equations of relativity a few weeks before einstein submitted his
paper most believe their work independent especially given einstein s isolation at this time a fourth paper does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content ist die tr gheit eines k rpers von seinem energieinhalt abh ngig published late in one nine
zero five showed one further deduction from relativity s axioms the famous equation that the energy of a body at rest e equals its mass m times the speed of light c squared e mc middle years einstein at the one nine one one solvay conference in one nine zero six einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class in one nine zero eight einstein was licensed in bern switzerland as a privatdozent unsalaried teacher at a university einstein s second son eduard was born on
july two eight one nine one zero at this time he described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of critical opalescence which shows the cumulative effect of scattering of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere in one nine one one einstein became first associate professor at the university of zurich and shortly afterwards full professor at the german university of prague only to return the following year
to zurich in order to become full professor at the eth zurich at that time he worked closely with the mathematician marcel grossmann in one nine one two einstein started to refer to time as the fourth dimension although h g wells had done this earlier in one eight nine five in the time machine in one nine one four just before the start of world war i einstein settled in berlin as professor at the local university and
became a member of the prussian academy of sciences he took german citizenship his pacifism and jewish origins irritated german nationalists after he became world famous nationalistic hatred of him grew and for the first time he was the subject of an organized campaign to discredit his
theories from one nine one four to one nine three three he served as director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics in berlin and it was during this time that he was awarded his nobel prize and made his
most groundbreaking discoveries he was also an extraordinary professor at the leiden university from one nine two zero until officially one nine four six where he regularly gave guest lectures in one nine one seven einstein published on the quantum mechanics of radiation zur quantenmechanik der strahlung physkalische zeitschrift one eight one two one one two eight this article introduced the concept of stimulated emission the physical
principle that allows light amplification in the laser he also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behavior of the entire universe setting the stage for modern cosmology in this work he created his self described worst blunder the cosmological constant einstein
divorced mileva on february one four one nine one nine and married his cousin elsa l wenthal born einstein l wenthal was the surname of her first husband max on june two one nine one nine elsa was albert s first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally she was three years older than albert and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment there were no children from this marriage the fate of albert and mileva s first child lieserl is unknown some believe she died in infancy
while others believe she was given out for adoption they later had two sons eduard and hans albert eduard intended to practice as a freudian analyst but was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum hans albert his older brother became a professor of hydraulic engineering at
the university of california berkeley having little interaction with his father einstein theory triumphs declared the new york times on november one zero one nine one nine general relativity in november one nine one five einstein presented a series of lectures before the prussian academy of sciences in which he described his theory of gravity known as general relativity the final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced
newton s law of gravity the field equation which was first derived from a variational principle by david hilbert this theory considered all observers to be equivalent not only those moving at a uniform speed in general relativity gravity is no longer a force as it is in newton s law of gravity but is a consequence of the curvature of space time the theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave
scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were discovered well after einstein s death a truly revolutionary theory general relativity has so far passed every test posed to it and has become a powerful tool used in the
analysis of many subjects in physics initially scientists were skeptical because the theory was derived by mathematical reasoning and rational analysis not by experiment or observation but in one nine one nine predictions made using the theory were confirmed by arthur eddington s measurements during a solar eclipse of
how much the light emanating from a star was bent by the sun s gravity when it passed close to the sun an effect called gravitational lensing the observations were carried out on may two nine one nine one nine at two locations one in sobral cear brazil and
another in the island of principe in the west coast of africa on november seven the times reported the confirmation cementing einstein s fame many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from disagreement with einstein s interpretation of the experiments to not being able to tolerate the absence of an absolute frame of reference in einstein s view many of them simply could not understand the mathematics involved einstein s public fame which followed the one nine one nine article created resentment among these scientists some of which lasted well into the one
nine three zero s in the early one nine two zero s einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the
university of berlin on march three zero one nine two one einstein went to new york to give a lecture on his new theory of relativity the same year he was awarded the nobel prize though he is now most famous for his work on
relativity it was for his earlier work on the photoelectric effect that he was given the prize as his work on general relativity was still disputed the nobel committee decided that citing his less contested theory in the prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community sir edmund whittaker one nine five three stated that david hilbert published the theory of general relativity nearly simultaneously with einstein the copenhagen interpretation einstein and niels bohr sparred
over quantum theory during the one nine two zero s einstein s postulation that light can be described not only as a wave
with no kinetic energy but also as massless discrete packets of energy called quanta with measurable kinetic energy now known as photons was a landmark break with the classical physics in one nine zero nine einstein presented his first paper on the quantification of light to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together in the mid one nine two zero s
as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of quantum mechanics einstein balked at the copenhagen interpretation of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic non visualizable account of physical behaviour einstein agreed that the theory was the best available but he looked for a more complete explanation i e more deterministic he could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern real things the belief which had led to his successes with atoms photons and gravity
in a one nine two six letter to max born einstein made a remark that is now famous quantum mechanics is certainly imposing but an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing the theory says a lot but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the old one i at any rate am convinced that he does not throw dice to this bohr who sparred with einstein on quantum theory retorted stop telling god what he must do the bohr einstein debates on
foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the solvay conferences einstein was not rejecting probabilistic theories per se einstein himself
was a great statistician using statistical analysis in his works on brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before the miraculous year one nine zero five einstein had even discovered gibbs ensembles he believed
however that at the core reality behaved deterministically many physicists argue that experimental evidence contradicting this belief was found much later with the discovery of bell s theorem and bell s inequality nonetheless there is still space for lively discussions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics bose einstein statistics in one nine two four einstein received a short paper from a young indian physicist named satyendra nath bose describing light as a gas of photons and asking for einstein s assistance in publication einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms
and published an article in german then the lingua franca of physics which described bose s model and explained its implications bose einstein statistics now describe any assembly of these indistinguishable particles known as bosons the bose einstein condensate phenomenon was predicted in the one nine two zero s by bose and einstein based on bose s work on the statistical mechanics of photons which was then formalized and generalized by einstein the first such condensate was produced by
eric cornell and carl wieman in one nine nine five at the university of colorado at boulder einstein s original sketches on this theory were recovered in august
two zero zero five in the library of leiden university einstein also assisted erwin schr dinger in the development of the quantum boltzmann distribution a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the bose einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper
the einstein refrigerator einstein and szil rd s refrigerator patent diagram einstein and former student le szil rd co invented a unique type of refrigerator usually called the

war ii when adolf hitler came to power in january one nine three three einstein was a guest professor at princeton university a position which he took in december one nine three two after a invitation from the american educator abraham flexner in one nine three three the nazis passed the law of the restoration of the civil service which forced all jewish university professors out of their jobs and throughout the one nine three zero s a campaign to label einstein s work as jewish physics in contrast with german or aryan physics was led by nobel laureates philipp
lenard and johannes stark with the assistance of the ss the deutsche physik supporters worked to publish pamplets and textbooks denigrating einstein s theories and attempted to politically blacklist german physicists who taught them notably werner heisenberg einstein renounced his german citizenship and stayed in the united states where he was given permanent residency he accepted a position at the newly founded institute for advanced study in princeton township new jersey he became an american citizen in one nine four zero though he still retained swiss citizenship
in one nine three nine under the encouragement of szil rd einstein sent a letter to president franklin delano roosevelt urging the study of nuclear fission for military purposes under fears that the nazi government would be first to develop atomic weapons roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive manhattan project einstein himself did not work on the bomb project however the international rescue committee was founded one nine three three at the request of albert einstein to assist opponents of adolf hitler for more information see the section
below on einstein s political views institute for advanced study his work at the institute for advanced study focused on the unification of the laws of physics which he referred to as the unified field theory he attempted to construct a model which would describe all of the fundamental forces as different manifestations of a single force
this took the form of an attempt to unify the gravitational and electrodynamic forces his attempt was hindered because the strong and weak nuclear forces were not understood independently until around one nine seven zero fifteen years after einstein s death einstein s goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for unification of the forces embodied most notably by string theory generalized theory
einstein began to form a generalized theory of gravitation with the universal law of gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification
of the fundamental forces in one nine five zero he described his work in a scientific american article einstein was guided by a belief in a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws einstein s generalized theory of gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to
field theory he investigated reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident einstein tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism in a way that also led to a new subtle understanding of quantum mechanics einstein postulated a four dimensional space time continuum expressed in axioms represented
by five component vectors particles appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high einstein treated subatomic particles as objects embedded in the unified field influencing it and
existing as an essential constituent of the unified field but not of it einstein also investigated a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields treating the combination of two parts of the field as being a natural procedure of the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately he researched a way to delineate the equations and systems to be derived from
a variational principle einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalised theory of gravitation and was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts in particular his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large most notably the discovery of the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force einstein s two story house white frame with front porch in greek revival style in princeton one one two mercer street final years in one nine four eight einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding
of brandeis university a portrait of einstein was taken by yousuf karsh on february one one of that same year in one nine five two the israeli government proposed to einstein that he take the post of second president he declined the offer and remains the only united states citizen ever to be offered a position as a foreign head of state on march three zero one nine five three einstein released a revised unified field theory he died at one one five
am in princeton hospital in princeton new jersey on april one eight one nine five five at the age of seven six from
internal bleeding which was caused by the rupture of an aortic aneurism leaving the generalized theory of gravitation unsolved
the only person present at his deathbed a hospital nurse said that just before his death he mumbled several words in german that she did not understand he was cremated without ceremony on the same day he died at trenton
new jersey in accordance with his wishes his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location an autopsy was performed on einstein by dr thomas stoltz harvey who removed and preserved his brain harvey found nothing unusual with his brain but in one nine nine nine further analysis by a team at mcmaster university revealed that his parietal operculum region was missing and to compensate his inferior parietal lobe was one five wider than normal the inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought visuospatial cognition and imagery of movement einstein s brain also contained seven three more glial cells
than the average brain personality albert einstein was much respected for his kind and friendly demeanor rooted in his pacifism he was modest about his abilities and had distinctive attitudes and fashions for example he minimized his wardrobe so that he would not need to waste time in deciding on what to wear he was captivatingly simple wearing mothy sweaters and sweatshirts and sans socks in his old age he occasionally had a playful sense of
humor and enjoyed sailing and playing the violin he was also the stereotypical bumbling absent minded professor he was often forgetful of everyday items such as keys and would focus so intently on solving physics problems that he
would often become oblivious to his surroundings in his later years his appearance inadvertently created or reflected another stereotype of scientist in the process
the researcher with unruly white hair religious views although he was raised jewish he was not a believer in
the religious aspect of judaism though he still considered himself a jew he simply admired the beauty of nature and the universe from a letter written in english dated march two four one nine five four einstein wrote it was of course a lie what you read about my religious
convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called
religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far
as our science can reveal it he also said in an essay reprinted in living philosophies vol one three one nine three one a knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity in this sense and this sense alone i am a deeply religious man the following is a response made to rabbi herbert goldstein of the international synagogue in new york which
read i believe in spinoza s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with the
fates and actions of human beings after being pressed on his religious views by martin buber einstein exclaimed what we physicists strive for is just to draw his lines after him he also quoted once when i read the bhagavad gita i ask myself how god created the universe everything else seems superfluous summarizing his religious beliefs he once said my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable
superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind einstein was an honorary associate of the rationalist press association beginning in one nine three four and was an admirer of ethical culture political views einstein and solomon mikhoels the chairman of the soviet jewish anti fascist committee in one nine four three einstein considered himself a pacifist and humanitarian and in later years a committed democratic socialist he once said i believe gandhi s views
were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time we should strive to do things in his spirit not to use violence for fighting for our cause but by non participation of anything you believe is evil einstein s views on other issues including socialism mccarthyism and
racism were controversial in a one nine four nine article entitled why socialism albert einstein described the predatory phase of human development exemplified by a chaotic capitalist society as a source of evil to be overcome he disapproved of the totalitarian regimes in the soviet union and elsewhere and argued in favor of a democratic socialist system which would combine a planned economy with a deep respect for human rights einstein was a co founder of the liberal german democratic party and a member of the afl
cio affiliated union the american federation of teachers einstein was very much involved in the civil rights movement he was a close friend of paul robeson for over two zero years einstein was a member of several civil rights groups including the princeton chapter of the naacp many of which were headed by paul robeson he served as co chair
with paul robeson of the american crusade to end lynching when w e b dubois was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the mccarthy era while he was in his eight zero s einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case
the case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity einstein was quoted as saying that racism is america s greatest disease the u s fbi kept a one four two seven page file on his

unmolested and result in government in name only among other charges they also alleged that einstein was a member sponsor or affiliated with thirty four communist fronts between one nine three seven one nine five four and
also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations it should be noted that many of the documents in the file were submitted to the fbi mainly by civilian political groups and not actually written by fbi officials in one nine three
nine einstein signed a letter written by le szil rd to president roosevelt arguing that the united states should start funding research into the development of nuclear weapons einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government and for this reason and his jewish background opposed the nazi regime and fled germany shortly after it came to power at the same time einstein s anarchist nephew carl einstein who shared many of his views was fighting the fascists in the spanish civil war
einstein initially favored construction of the atomic bomb in order to ensure that hitler did not do so first and even sent a letter to president roosevelt dated august two one nine three nine before world war ii broke out and probably written by le szil rd encouraging him to initiate a program to create
a nuclear weapon roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using uranium as a weapon which in a few years was superseded by the manhattan project after the war though einstein lobbied for nuclear disarmament and a world government i do not know
how the third world war will be fought but i can tell you what they will use in the fourth rocks einstein was a supporter of zionism he supported jewish settlement of the ancient seat of judaism and
was active in the establishment of the hebrew university in jerusalem which published one nine three zero a volume titled about zionism speeches and lectures by professor albert einstein and to which einstein bequeathed his papers however he opposed nationalism and expressed skepticism about whether a jewish nation state was the best solution he may have imagined jews and arabs living peacefully in the same land in
later life in one nine five two he was offered the post of second president of the newly created state of israel but declined the offer claiming that he lacked the necessary people skills einstein was disturbed by the violence taking place in the palestine after the second world war and expressed that he was disappointed
with the jewish ultra nationalist organization irgun and stern gang nonetheless einstein remained deeply committed to the welfare of israel and the jewish people for the rest of his life einstein along with albert schweitzer and bertrand russell fought against nuclear tests and bombs as his last public act and just days before his death he signed the russell einstein manifesto which led to the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs his letter to russell read dear bertrand russell

to a regional bloc in either south asia or the middle east as it has cultural ethno linguistic and geographic links with most of its neighbors it is bordered by iran in the west pakistan in the south and east turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan in the north and china to the east it has a population of three zero million people although this remains an estimate as no official census has been taken for decades afghanistan literally translates to land of the afghans but a plethora of other names have been applied to its general location in the past between
the fall of the taliban after the u s invasion of
afghanistan and the two zero zero three loya jirga afghanistan was referred to by the government of the united states as the transitional islamic state of afghanistan under its new constitution the country is now officially named
the islamic republic of afghanistan origin and history of the name the name of afghanistan derives from word afghan the pushtuns appear to have begun using the term afghan as a name for themselves from the islamic period onwards according to w k frazier tyler m c gillet and several other scholars the word afghan first appears in history in the hudud al alam in nine eight two ad there are numerous views regarding the origin of name afghan most of them being purely speculative as can be seen below makhzan i afghni by nematullah
written in one six one two ce traces the afghan or pakhtun origin from the super patriarch abraham down to one named king talut or saul it states that saul had a son irmia jeremia who had a son called afghana upon the death of king saul afghana was raised by david and was later promoted to the chief command of the army during the reign of king solomon the progeny of this afghana multiplied
numerously and came to be called bani israel in the sixth century bce bakhtunnasar or nebuchadnezzar king of babul attacked judah and exiled the progeny of afghana to ghor located in the center of what is now afghanistan in course of time the exiled community came to be addressed as afghan after the name of their ancestor and the country got its name as afghanistan this traditional view has many historical discrepancies and is therefore not accepted by modern scholarship the last pleader for the bani israel
hypothesis being mayor raverty the pathans one nine five eight olaf caroe another version of pushtun legend places afghana the professed eponymous ancestor of the afghans or pushtuns as a contemporary of muslim prophet mohammad on hearing about the new faith of islam qais from aryana travelled to medina to see the
muslim prophet muhammad and returned to aryana as a muslim qais abdur rashid purportedly had many sons one of whom was afghana afghana in turn had four sons who set out to the east to establish their separate lineages the first son went to swat the second to lahore and india the third to multan and the last one to quetta this legend is one of many traditional tales amongst the pashtuns regarding their disparate origins again it was this legendary afghana who is stated to have given the pushtuns
their current name it is notable that the afghan of this legend is separated from the afghana of solomon s times by at least one one centuries dr h w bellew in his book an enquiry into the ethnography of afghanistan believes that the name afghan derives from the
latin term alban used by armenians as alvan or alwan which refers to mountaineers and in the case of transliterated armenian characters would be pronounced as aghvan or aghwan to the persians this would further be altered to aoghan avghan and afghan as a reference to the highlanders or mountaineers of the eastern iranian plateau some people hold that the name derives from abagan i e without god which term the persians are stated to have coined for the pushtuns to describe them as godless or non believers it is claimed that word abagan is antonym
of the word bagan believer in god just as word apolitical is antonym of political in the english language there are also a few people who link afghan to an uzbek word avagan said to mean original still others believe that the name derives from sanskrit upa ganah said to mean allied tribes another etymological view is that the name afghan evidently derives from sanskrit ashvaka or ashvakan q v the assakenoi of arrian this view was propounded by j w mccrindle and is supported by numerous modern scholars including c lassen s martin
bishop crooks w crooke j c vidyalnar m r singh p
smith n l dey dr j l kamboj s kirpal singh and several others in sanskrit word ashva iranian aspa prakrit assa means horse and ashvaka prakrit assaka means horseman pre christian times knew the people of eastern afghanistan as ashvakas horsemen since they raised a fine breed of horses
and had a reputation for providing expert cavalrymen the fifth century bce indian grammarian panini calls them ashvayana and ashvakayana classical writers use the respective equivalents aspasios or aspasii hippasii and assakenois or assaceni assacani asscenus the aspasios
assakenois ashvakas cavalrymen is stated to be another name for the kambojas because of their equestrian characteristics see list of country name etymologies the last part of the name afghanistan originates from the persian word st n country or land the english word afghanland that
appeared in various treaties between qajar persia and the united kingdom dealing with the eastern lands of the persian kingdom modern afghanistan was adopted by the afghans and became afghanistan before being called afghanistan the region had gone through several name changes in its long history of around five zero zero zero years one
of the most ancient names according to historians and scholars was ariana the greek pronunciation of the ancient avestan aryanam vaeja or the sanskrit aryavarta land of the aryans today this old persian and avestan expression is preserved in the name iran and it is noted in the name of the afghan national airline ariana airlines the term ariana afghanistan is still popular amongst persian speakers in the country many centuries later afghanistan was part of greater khorasan and hence was recognized with the name khorasan along with regions centered around merv
and neishabur which in pahlavi means the eastern land in persian dehkhoda p eight four five seven history afghanistan exists at a unique nexus point where numerous eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity through the ages the region today known as afghanistan has been invaded by a host of peoples including the aryans medes persians greeks mauryans
kushans sassanians arabs turks british and soviets but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region on other occasions native afghan entities have invaded surrounding regions to form empires of their own buddhas of bamiyan dating back to one st century pre islamic afghanistan were the largest buddha statues in the world they were destroyed by the taliban in two zero zero one

became known as ary n m x a ra or land of the aryans zoroastrianism is speculated to have possibly originated in afghanistan between one eight zero zero to eight zero zero bce ancient eastern iranian languages such as avestan may have been spoken in afghanistan around a similar time line with the rise of zoroastrianism around one zero zero zero bce or earlier the indo aryan vedic civilization may have arisen near the vicinity of the kabul valley of eastern afghanistan but this remains
speculative as more viable theories based upon archaeological finds tend to support the emergence of the vedic civilization east of the indus and or ganges in what is today pakistan and india by the middle of the six th century bce the persian empire supplanted the medes and incorporated aryana within its boundaries and by three three zero bce alexander the great had invaded the region following alexander s brief occupation the hellenic successor states of the seleucids
and bactrians controlled the area while the mauryans from india annexed the southeast for a time and introduced buddhism to the region until the area returned to the bactrian
rule during the one st century ce the kushans a tocharian people from central asia with indo european origins occupied the region thereafter aryana fell to a number of eurasian tribes including parthians scythians and huns as well as the sassanian persians and local rulers such as the hindu shahis in kabul until the seven th century ce when muslim arab armies invaded the region the
arabs initially annexed parts of western afghanistan in six five two and then conquered most of the rest of afghanistan between seven zero six seven zero nine ce and administered the region as khorasan and over time much of the local population converted to islam but retained their iranian languages afghanistan became the center of various important empires including the ghaznavid empire nine six two one one five one founded by a local turkic ruler from ghazni named yamin ul dawlah mahmud that expanded
its suzerainty over a vast area from kurdistan to northern india this empire was replaced by the ghorid empire one one five one one two one nine founded by another local ruler this time of tajik extraction muhammad ghori whose domains included huge parts of central and south asia and laid the foundations for the delhi sultanate in india in one two one nine the region was overrun by the mongols under genghis khan who devastated the land their rule continued with the ilkhanates and was extended further following the invasion of tamerlane timur leng a ruler

game that afghanistan regained complete independence during the period of british intervention in afghanistan ethnic pashtun territories were divided by the durand line and this would lead to strained relations between afghanistan and british india and later the new state of pakistan over what came to be known as the pashtunistan debate the historical
rulers of afghanistan were part of the abdali tribe of the ethnic afghans whose name was changed to durrani upon the accession of ahmad shah they belonged to the saddozay segment of the popalzay clan or to the mohammadzay segment of the barakzay clan of the ethnic afghans

population continues to suffer from insufficient food clothing housing medical care and other problems exacerbated by military operations
and political uncertainties the government is not strong enough to collect customs duties from all the provinces due to the power of the warlords fraud is widespread and corruption is rife within all afghan government organs and central authority is barely felt in the lawless south and south west the economist two zero zero five expanding poppy cultivation and
a growing opium trade is another huge problem for the country the cia estimates that one third of the country s gdp comes from opium export although the asian development bank states a lower

are also highly useful to the us forces in scouting providing local intelligence keeping their own territories clean from al qaeda and taliban insurgents and even taking part in military operations all for money this also contributes to the lack of central government s real authority in provinces and
discourages farmers from growing grain and fruit as they did for centuries previously in short the
afghan economy is currently december two zero zero five going through a hefty change period on the one hand there are encouraging signs of positive development and increasing wealth creation and management but on the other hand the security situation the lingering war against terrorism and the opium problem have created tall barriers for afghanistan to rejoin the international community in prosperity and economic development economy references fujimura manabu two zero zero four afghan economy after the election asian development bank institute cia factbook two zero zero

european invasions their presence can be traced back to nine zero zero bc when their political structure was formulated in the seven th and six th centuries bc excellent metal craftsmen and fierce warriors the illyrians formed warlord based kingdoms that fought amongst themselves for most of their history only during the six th century did the illyrians venture significant raids against their immediate neighbours the kingdom of the molossians in southern albania the kingdom of macedon and the kingdom of paionia besides

or aelle ii of northumbria or aelle of sussex men s names allah ed din and similar are misspellings for ala ud din and see here for other sorts of error the word is the arabic term for god in other languages it is often used to refer specifically to the islamic concept of god see usage below etymology usage although outside the arab world use of the word all h is
most often associated with islam it is not exclusive to that faith arab christians and various arabic speaking jews including the teimanim several communities and some sephardim also use it to refer to the monotheist deity arabic translations of the bible also employ it as do roman catholics in malta who pronounce it as alla christians in indonesia who say allah bapa god the father and christians in the middle east who use the aramaic all ha allah as a word many linguists believe that the term all h is derived
from a contraction of the arabic words al the and il h deity masculine form al il h meaning the god in addition one of the main pagan goddesses of pre islamic arabia all t al il h at or the goddess is cited as being etymologically though not synchronically the feminine linguistic counterpart to the
grammatically masculine all h if so the word all h is an abbreviated title meaning the deity rather than a name for this
reason both muslim and non muslim scholars often translate all h directly into english as god this also explains why arabic speaking jews and christians freely refer to god as all h however some muslim scholars feel that all h should not be translated because they perceived the arabic word to express the uniqueness of all h more accurately than the
word god which can take a plural gods whereas the word all h has no plural form this is a significant issue in translation of the qur an all h written in simple arabic calligraphy the word all h is always
written without an alif to spell the vowel this is because the spelling was settled before arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell however in vocalized spelling a diacritic alif is added on top of the shaddah to indicate pronunciation one exception is in the pre islamic zabad inscription where it is spelled unicode has glyph reserved for allah u fdf two which can be combined with an alif to yield the post consonantal form as
opposed to the full spelling alif l m l m h which may be rendered slightly differently in particular featuring a diacritic alif on top of the shadda in this unicode imitates traditional arabic typesetting which also frequently featured special ll h types also in abjad numerals the name of allah numeric
value is six six islamic use of all h from the point of view of traditional islamic theology all h is the most precious name of god because it is not a descriptive name like other ninety nine
names of god but the name of god s own presence muslims
believe that the name of allah had existed before the time of adam it is the same god worshipped by adam noah abraham moses jesus muhammad and other prophets of islam in
islam there is only one god and muhammad is the last messenger the emphasis in islamic culture on reciting the qur an in arabic has resulted in all h often being used by muslims world wide as the word for god regardless of their native language out of one one four suras in the qur an one
one three begin with the basmala bismi ll hi r rahm ni r rah m which means in the name of god the most kind the most merciful muslims when referring to the name often add the words subhanahu wa ta ala after it meaning glorified and exalted is he as a sign of reverence or azza wa jalla the entire religion of islam is based on the idea of getting closer to god although commonly referred to
as a he god is considered genderless but there is no neuter gender to express this in the arabic language when greek or other polytheistic deities are discussed in arabic it is customary to use the expression il h a deity or lower case god sometimes the word ma b d literally meaning worshipped entity is used instead uses of all h in phrases there are many phrases that contain the word all h all hu akbar god is the greatest a uzu billahi minashaitanir rajim i seek refuge in
allah from shaitan the damned bismi ll h in the name of god insh all h god willing also the origin of the common spanish interjection ojal which shares a similar meaning probably also the origin of the portuguese interjection oxal let s hope for it or let s hope that y all h oh god may be the origin of the spanish
and portuguese exclamation ol m sh all h look at what god has willed subh n all h glory be to god al hamdu li ll h all praise be to god all hu a alam god
knows best jazaka all hu khayran may god reward you for your deeds all h appears in a stylized form on the flag of
iran in the phrase all hu akbar on the flag of iraq and as part of the shah dah on the flag of saudi arabia allah is not correctly used as a man s name
see arabic name mistakes made by europeans and other non arabs islamic concept of god the islamic concept of mankind s place in the universe hinges on the notion that all h or god is the only true reality there is nothing permanent other than him god is considered eternal and uncreated whereas everything else in the universe is created the qur an describes him in sura one one two say he is all h singular all h the absolute he begetteth not nor was begotten and to him
have never been one equal see tawhid for more the qur an condemns and mocks the pre islamic arabs for attributing daughters to all h sura five three one nine muslims believe that all h or god is the only true god who deserves to be worshipped this belief must be accompanied by
the acknowledgement that mohammad was a true prophet of god who was
chosen to guide people to believing and worshipping god in the correct manner god is considered eternal and uncreated with no beginning whereas everything else in the universe is created with a beginning the qur an mentions approximated in english sura one one two say he is
all h without partner all h the absolute he begetteth not nor was begotten and to him have never been one equal see
tawhid for more god is considered by muslims to be omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient in the qur an god is described as being fully aware of everything that happens in the universe and knows all things god also knows what is in people s hearts and minds at all times it is mentioned in the qur an approximately and he it is who takes your souls at night in sleep and he knows what you acquire in the day then he raises you up therein that an appointed
term may be fulfilled then to him is your return then he will inform you of what you were doing sura six six zero placing god inside his creation or suggesting that nature or creation simultaneously co exist in god or vice versa as in other religious traditions completely compromises exclusive islamic monotheism attributing a partner spouse father son daughter mother or other relation s to allah literally or metaphorically partially or completely is considered unquestionably blasphemous by muslims therefore muslims consider it blasphemous to
describe jesus or another man woman child etc as son of god whether literally or metaphorically similarly muslims do not believe that god resembles a man old or young woman half man half woman half man half animal bird elephant or other animal or other creation it is forbidden for muslims to view god anthropomorphically allah does not resemble any of his creations in any way whatsoever allah is not
attributed with shape colour size position location direction and indeed all of these attributes are found in the creatures allah created further muslims do not believe that allah is located in a place whether on earth below the earth in the sky above the sky on a throne above the sky or all of these places at once or anywhere else or everywhere but rather god exists without a place given he created all places and locations and the perfectness
of his existence is not compromised by his existence not being bound to a created by allah place or location god is attributed with complete perfection in his attributes and is free from any defects or any imperfections allah is attributed amongst other attributes with oneness without a partner in god s self or attributes non beginningness eternalness complete freedom from needing others i e each or any of his creations complete power to do all things will to do as he wills as and when god
decides without any obstruction knowledge of all things simultaneously past present and future hearing of all sounds without needing any implement or organ to hear sight without needing eyes or any other organ or instrument nor light rays to illuminate an area or an object life unlike the human or other life which is created and limited but that which befits him with no beginning or end speech unlike the human created speech which is constituted of languages letters and sounds but rather an eternal speech which is not a creation but an attribute of god
and the complete non resemblence of any creation in his self or attributes history it was used in pre islamic times by pagans within the arabian peninsula to signify the supreme creator pre islamic jews referred to their supreme creator as yahweh or elohim the pagan arabs recognized all h as the supreme god in their
pantheon along with allah however the pre islamic arabs believed in a host of other gods such as hubal and daughters of all h the three daughters associated were al l t al uzzah
and manah encyclopedia of world mythology and legend the facts on file ed anthony mercatante new york one nine eight three i six one this view of allah by the pre islamic pagans is viewed by muslims as a latter development having arisen as a result of moving away from abrahamic monotheism over time some of the names of these pagan gods are said to be derived from the descendants of noah whom latter generations firstly revered as saints and then
transformed into gods although non muslims often view polytheism as having come before monotheism the pagan arabians also used the word all h in the names of their children muhammad s father who was born into pagan society was named abdull h which translates servant of all h abdull h is still used for names of muslim and non muslim arabs the hebrew word for deity el or el ah was used as an old testament synonym for yahweh which is the proper name for
the jewish god according to the tanakh the aramaic word for god is al h syriac dialect or el h biblical dialect which comes from the same proto semitic word il h as the arabic and hebrew terms jesus is described in mark one five three four as having used
the word on the cross with the ending meaning my when saying my god my god why hast thou forsaken me transliterated in greek as el i one of the earliest surviving translations of the word into a foreign language is in a greek translation of the shahada from eight six nine six ah seven
zero five seven one five ad which translates it as ho theos monos literally the one god also the cognate aramaic term appears in the aramaic version of the new testament called the pshitta or peshitta as one of the words jesus used to refer to god e g in
the sixth beatitude blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see al ha and in the arabic bible the same words mt five eight other beliefs the nation of gods and earths one of the many sects created as the result of black separatist movements in the united states holds that the word all h is the name of the original black man and stands for arm leg leg arm head this concept is alien to mainstream islam which strictly opposes any attempt to portray all h as a human or in any other way mainstream
islam also prohibits attibuting divine qualities to worshipping or glorifying anything other than all h the bah faith whose are primarily written in arabic and farsi also uses allah to mean god though in practice the customary word for god in the local language is typically used when speaking in that language some particular uses are not translated but the arabic phrase is used the chief example of this would be the bah customary greeting all h u abh which is commonly translated

mountains close to the neck between the ross sea and the weddell sea the portion of the continent west of the weddell sea and east of the ross sea is called western antarctica and the remainder eastern antarctica because they correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the greenwich meridian western antarctica is covered by the west antarctic ice sheet about nine eight percent of antarctica is covered by an ice sheet that is
on average two five kilometers thick vinson massif the highest peak in antarctica at four eight nine two meters is located in the ellsworth mountains the west antarctic ice sheet has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse if it does break down ocean levels would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time despite its zero rainfall in some areas the continent has approximately nine zero of the world s fresh water in the form of ice mt erebus an active volcano in ross island although antarctica is home

there is some evidence that vostok s waters may contain microbial life due to the lake s similarity to europa a moon of jupiter confirming that life can survive in lake vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on europa geology gondwana breakup more than one seven zero million years ago mya antarctica was part of the supercontinent gondwana africa separated from antarctica around one six zero mya follwed by india in the early cretaceous about one two five mya about six five mya antarctica then still connected to australia had still tropical to
subtropical climate complete with a marsupial fauna but by about four five mya australia new guinea had separated from antarctica and the first ice appeared at around two five mya due to the opening of the drake passage between antarctica and south america and the resulting antarctic circumpolar current the ice spread quickly displacing the forests that then covered the continent since about one five mya the continent has been mostly covered with ice climate the blue ice covering lake fryxell in the transantarctic mountains comes from glacial meltwater from the canada glacier and other smaller glaciers
antarctica is the coldest place on earth antarctica has little rainfall with the south pole getting none making it a continental desert temperatures reach a minimum of between eight five and nine zero degrees celsius one two one and one three zero degrees fahrenheit in the winter and about three zero degrees higher in the summer months sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over nine zero of the sunlight falling on it eastern antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the
continent leaving the center cold and dry there is little precipitation over the central portion of the continent but ice there can last for extended time periods however heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent where snowfalls of up to one two two meters four eight inches in four eight hours have been recorded at the edge of the continent strong katabatic winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force in the interior however wind speeds are often moderate
during summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the south pole than is received at the equator in an equivalent period depending on the latitude long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent the aurora australis commonly known as the southern

whales and fur seals more specifically the emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in antarctica the ad lie penguin breeds further south than any penguin the rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes one could call them elaborate eyelashes king penguins are also predominant in the antarctic the antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the one eight th and one nine th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the united states and the
united kingdom antarctic krill which congregate in large schools is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the southern ocean and is an important food organism for whales seals leopard seals fur seals squid icefish penguins albatrosses and many other birds the approval of the antarctic conservation act brought several restrictions to the continent the introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty as can the extraction of any indigenous species the overfishing of krill which plays a large role in the antarctic ecosystem led officials to enact regulations

many rural towns become ghost towns when train services were abandoned and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of imported cheap goods in part because of the monetary policy which kept the u s dollar exchange
rate fixed and low many slums villas miseria sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities inhabited by empoverished low class urban dwellers and migrants from smaller towns in the interior of the country however it is important to note that the majority of the people that live in these newly formed small shanty towns are people that came from neighboring countries
during the time of convertibility and never left this immigration of humble people from a low socioeconomic status represented an undesirable change because shanty towns and homeless people begging for money was something argentines didn t know until the economic disaster of the one nine nine zero s however the government works actively to try to include these
new inmigrants into argentine society and considers their children born in argentina to be argentines there are no plans to build any type of wall to keep these inmigrants out argentina adheres to a policy of allowing anybody who wants to come to argentina to come freely without restrictive inmigration measures in this respect argentina is more progressive than many fully developed countries argentina s urban areas have a european look reflecting the influence of their european settlers many towns
and cities are built like spanish cities around a main square called a plaza a cathedral and important government buildings often face the plaza the general layout of the cities is called a damero that is a checkerboard since it is based on a pattern of square blocks though modern developments sometimes depart from

organised as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals in descending order by number of inhabitants the major cities in argentina are buenos aires c rdoba rosario mendoza la plata tucum n mar del plata salta santa fe and bah a blanca geography map of argentina argentina can roughly be divided into three parts the fertile plains of the

sector and a diversified industrial base the country historically had a large middle class compared to other latin american countries but this segment of the population
was decimated by a succession of economic crises today while a significant segment of the population is still financially well off they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it since the late one nine seven zero s the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high inflation in one nine nine one the government pegged the peso to the u s dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base the government then embarked on a path of
trade liberalisation deregulation and privatisation inflation dropped and gdp grew but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits causing it to crumble in slow motion from one nine nine five and up to the collapse in two zero
zero one by two zero zero two argentina had defaulted on its debt its gdp had shrunk unemployment was over two five the peso had devalued seven five after being floated and inflation was hitting again however careful spending control and heavy taxes on now soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct monetary policy in two zero zero three import substitution policies and soaring exports coupled with a lower inflation and

site of the biblical garden of eden armenia was a regional empire with a rich culture in the years leading up to the one st century spanning from the shores of the black sea to the caspian sea and the mediterranean sea during the rule of tigranes the great armenia s strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples including the assyrians persians greeks romans byzantines arabs turks and mongols in ad three zero

the surrounding districts of azerbaijan proper the economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of
a peaceful resolution politics the government of armenia s stated aim is to build a western style parliamentary democracy as the basis of its form of government however international observers have questioned the fairness of armenia s parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referenda since one nine nine five citing polling deficiencies lack of cooperation by the electoral commission and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places for the most part however armenia is considered one of the more pro democratic nations in the commonwealth of independent states the unicameral parliament also

are visible but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as sunspots and solar eclipses amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable

scientific research is not always the main goal for many amateur astronomers work of scientific merit is certainly possible however and many
amateurs contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers very successfully astronomy is often promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data
the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection in particular this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers several organisations such as the center for backyard astrophysics exist to help coordinate these contributions in particular amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such
as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars helping to track asteroids and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape
of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth in the past and present amateur astronomers have also played a major role in discovering new comets recently however funding of projects such as the lincoln near earth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them a newer role for amateurs is searching for overlooked phenomena e g kreutz sungrazers in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space
based observatories much of which is available over the internet societies for amateur astronomy there are a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy whether they be people who are
actively interested in observing or armchair astronomers who may be simply interested in the topic societies range widely in their goals depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread local circumstances size and membership for instance a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular
meetings with speakers focusing less on observing the night sky if the
membership is less able to observe due to factors such as light pollution it is common for local societies to hold regular meetings which may include activities such as star parties other activities could include
amateur telescope making which was pioneered in america by russell w porter who later played a major role in design and construction of the hale telescope approaches to using amateur telescopes amateur telescopes come in many shapes and sizes both commercial and home built the preferences of people who
use them often differ star hopping some amateur astronomers prefer to learn the sky as accurately as they can using maps to find their way between the stars in this case a common approach is to use binoculars or a manually driven telescope combined with star maps to locate items of interest in the sky the normal technique for doing this by locating landmark stars and hopping between them is
called star hopping goto telescopes more recently as technology has
improved and prices have come down automated goto telescopes have also become a popular choice with these computer driven telescopes the user typically enters the name of the item they wish to look at and the telescope finds it in the sky automatically with comparatively little further effort required by the user the main advantage of a goto telescope for an experienced amateur astronomer is the reduction of wasted time that may have otherwise been used in
trying to find a particular object this time can therefore be used more effectively for studying the object comparing methodologies there is significant though
usually light hearted debate within the hobby about which method is better promoters of the star hopping approach for finding items in the sky usually argue that they know the sky much better as a result the manual method also tends to require simpler equipment with less
calibration and setup time and is therefore more versatile promoters of goto telescopes often argue that they are more interested in studying objects and the reward of finding them or learning exactly where they are is not as important to them it may also be argued that the money spent on complex electronics and mounting systems might be better spent on higher quality optics additional tools and activities in addition to optical equipment amateur astronomers use a variety of other tools such as celestial maps and specialised
computer software there is a range of astronomy software available from planetarium programs that simulate the sky to programs used to do various kinds of calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena most amateur astronomers also keep a record of their
observations this can take the form of an observing log in which they record details about which objects were observed and describing the details that were seen astrophotography and sketching are also popularly used to record observations beginning in amateur astronomy there are a many ways for people to become involved in
amateur astronomy and study the night sky one option is to join a local astronomical society the members of which will often be very happy
to help a newcomer take a more active part some people also prefer to simply teach themselves in which case there are likely to be a large amount of books in the local library common objects that are observed early are the moon and planets another thing that most newcomers to amateur astronomy become acquainted with are the more prominent constellations in the night sky when reading maps and interpreting instructions for future star hopping constellations are good starting points for identifying locations in the
night sky they are frequently referred to by amateur astronomers when discussing the location of items of interest when looked at with binoculars and telescopes beginning with a goto telescope a relatively new type of beginning amateur astronomer brought about by the
increased affordability of powerful goto telescopes is one who begins with such a telescope it is possible for an inexperienced person to immediately look at a large amount of deep sky objects in the night sky without necessarily having any prior experience or training there is currently some debate among amateur astronomers about the merits
of this approach to becoming involved in the hobby and the effects that low priced goto telescopes may be having amateur astronomy is exposed to more people as an individual is less likely to be discouraged by the need to learn how to locate objects
in the night sky before being able to see them some are concerned however that newcomers may
become bored very quickly a goto telescope does not distinguish between objects that are easy and hard to see and newcomers may therefore begin with objects that require large amounts of experience or understanding to properly appreciate becoming acquainted with the night sky most tutors agree that it is very important to know one s way around the sky by means of the
constellations this ability forms a platform from which deeper explorations of the sky are then possible a planisphere can be used to find and identify the constellations these devises show the location of the constellations for any time of the night or time of the year an observer will also need a red flashlight to read star charts or the planisphere use of a red light helps preserve the dark adaptation of the eyes having learned the main constellations a beginner may want to extend their hobby and buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope using binoculars with binoculars
it is possible to see many deep sky objects dsos holding the binoculars can produce a shaky image one way to improve the view is with the aid of a sturdy tripod mount to steady the view through the binoculars binoculars are still limited in range although most of the messier catalogue should be visible as well as a great many ngc s especially near the
milky way an advantage of binoculars is that they allow more complete wide field views of the larger open clusters such as the pleiades the hyades the coma berenices cluster and praesepe for
example of which only portions are usually observable in one field of view at higher magnifications using a telescope with a telescope the sky really comes alive especially one
that has an aperture of six inches or more some amateur telescopes are built by their owners from scratch but many good quality telescopes can be purchased from reputable companies thousands of dsos are visible in a telescope and the determined amateur with a large about four one cm telescope can push this to tens of thousands
or more another type of telescope to consider especially if the amateur is observing with children is a wide field telescope such as edmund scientific s f four astroscan compact reflector this type of telescope is typically a
short tube reflector and has an aperture of only eight zero to one two zero mm three one four to four three four inches but is easier to target an object since it offers a much wider field of view with the aid of high power lenses i e eyepieces the amateur can zoom in on planets and some of the closer dsos it is the best of a blend of a telescope s narrow long range light gathering ability with
a binocular s wider field of view those who are particularly interested in observing
the moon and planets may prefer a high power design such as the maksutov telescope with any telescope though the mount is the most important feature a tripod that doesn t shake every time one uses it is a must too many amateur astronomers give up because they have a hard time targeting an object if the mounting tripod
is rock solid the amateur can enjoy their time observing the heavens instead of fighting with the telescope astrophotography a photo taken of comet hale bopp using a standard three five mm camera with a five zero mm lens and four zero zero iso film the exposure was taken for one zero seconds on a tripod using a shutter cable release the next step in an amateur astronomer s quest for more space adventure could
be the purchase of a good camera for astrophotography starting out with a good three five mm camera with a five zero mm lens mounted on a tripod and using a cable release and four zero zero or faster speed film the amateur can capture
some nice pictures of the planets and some larger nebula like the orion nebula some of the larger comets and prolific meteor showers can be photographed this way as well as one progresses cameras can be mounted directly on to telescopes capturing on film many dsos special films and even the technique of hypering the film has been employed by the amateur many publications accept these astrophotos in their magazines i e
astronomy and sky telescope a more recent development is the use of webcams to do speckle imaging also known as video astronomy the resulting short exposure frames can be stacked using the shift and add method of speckle imaging or selected to do lucky imaging all using commercially available astronomy software sketching
as an alternative to photography in order to make a record of observations amateurs also use sketching sketching does not require the use of any specialized equipment and is therefore suitable for beginners as well as advanced amateur observers there are different approaches to
sketching that require different tools simple pencil sketches can sometimes be used to make accurate renditions of what the observer sees through binoculars or a telescope as the expewrience of the observer increases more advanced drawing tools and techniques can be employed sketching has the advantage of helping the observer scrutinize the object that is seen and can help bring out details that otherwise might have been overlooked suggested reading some good books for amateur astronomers

amateur astrophotography reviews and articles amateur astronomy aikido aikid also
using an older style of kanji literally meaning joining energy way is a gendai budo a modern japanese martial art practitioners of aikido are known as aikidoka it was developed by morihei ueshiba also known by aikidoka as o sensei over the period of the one nine three zero s to the one nine six zero s technically
the major parts of aikido are derived from dait ry aiki j jutsu a form of jujutsu with many joint techniques and kenjutsu or japanese sword technique some believe the tactics in aikido are especially influenced by yagy shinkage ry aikido is also considered to contain a significant spiritual component history the name aikido
is formed of three japanese characters usually romanised as ai ki and do these are often translated as meaning union universal energy and way so aikido can be translated as the way
to union with universal energy another common interpretation of the characters is harmony spirit and way so aikido can also mean the way of spiritual harmony both interpretations draw attention to the fact that aikido s techniques are designed to control an attacker by controlling and redirecting their energy instead of blocking it an analogy is often made of the way a flexible willow bends with the storm whereas the stout oak will break if the
wind blows too hard the korean martial art commonly known as
hapkido uses the same three characters some suggest a historical link through daito ryu the main origin of aikido morihei ueshiba developed aikido mainly from daito ryu aikijutsu incorporating training movements such as those for the yari spear jo a short quarterstaff and perhaps also juken bayonet but arguably the strongest influence is that of the katana sword in many ways an aikido practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman the aikido strikes shomenuchi and yokomenuchi originated from weapon attacks and resultant techniques likewise from weapon take aways some schools of aikido do no weapons training
at all others such as iwama ryu usually spend substantial time with bokken bokuto wooden sword jo and tanto knife in some lines of aikido all techniques can be performed with a sword as well
as unarmed aikido was first brought to the west in one nine five one by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france it was introduced to the united states in one nine five three by kenji tomiki and a little later in the same year by koichi tohei the united kingdom followed in one nine five five germany and australia in one nine six five today there are many aikido dojos available to train at
throughout the world technique aikido incorporates a wide range of techniques which use principles of energy and motion to redirect neutralise and control attackers one of the central martial philosophies of aikido is to be able to handle multiple attacker circumstances
fluidly randori practice against multiple opponents is a key part of the curriculum in most aikido schools and is required for the higher level belts another tenet of aikido is that the aikidoka should gain control of their opponent as quickly as possible while causing the least amount of damage possible to either party if performed correctly size and strength are not important for the techniques to be effective training the methods of training vary from organisation to organisation and indeed even between different dojo in a single organisation typically however a class consists of a teacher demonstrating techniques
or principles which the students then practice training is done through mutual technique where the focus is on entering and blending harmonising with
the attack rather than on meeting force with force uke the receiver of the technique usually initiates an attack against nage also referred to as tori or shite depending on aikido style who neutralises it with an aikido technique the uke and the nage have equally important roles uke s role is to be honest and committed in attack to use positioning to protect oneself and
to learn proper technique through the imbalanced feeling created by nage s technique nage s role is to blend with and neutralise uke s attack without leaving an opening to further attacks simultaneously nage will be studying how to create a feeling of being centred on balance and controlled in the application of the aikido technique therefore
students must practise both positions in order to learn proper technique when o sensei taught all his students were uke until he deemed them knowledgeable enough of the technique to be nage movement awareness precision distance and timing are all important to the execution of techniques as students progress from rigidly defined exercises to more fluid and adaptable applications eventually students take part in jiyu waza free
attack and or randori where the attacks are less predictable most schools employ training methods wherein uke actively attempts to employ counter techniques or kaeshi waza o sensei did not allow competition in training because some techniques were considered too dangerous and because he believed that competition did not develop good character in students most styles of aikido continue this tradition although shodokan aikido see styles started with competitions early on in the ki society there are forms taigi competitions held from time to time defense aikido techniques are largely designed towards keeping the attacker off balance and locking joints
much of aikido s repertoire of defenses can be performed either as throwing techniques nage waza or as pins katame waza depending on the situation entering irimi and turning tenkan
are widely used aikido concepts as is striking atemi the use
of striking techniques is dependent on the organization and to some extent the individual dojo some dojo teach the strikes that are integral to all aikido techniques as mere distractions used to make the application of an aikido technique easier while others teach that strikes are to be used for more destructive reasons o sensei himself wrote while describing the aikido technique ikkyo first smash the eyes this might
well refer to the fact that the classic opener for ikkyo is a knife hand thrust towards the face to make uke block and thus expose his or her arm to the joint control thus as though moving to smash uke s eyes manipulation of uke s balance by entering is often referred to as taking
uke s center it is sometimes said that aikido contains only defense and the attacks that are performed are not really aikido from a historical perspective this claim is questionable but many
if not most aikidoka have the defense techniques as the focus of their training attacks in the early days when ueshiba began teaching to the public students tended to be proficient in another martial art due to this attacks per se are generally not focused on in contemporary aikido dojos students will learn the various attacks from which an aikido technique can be practiced although attacks seldom are studied to the same extent as some
arts good attacks are needed to study correct and effective application of technique honest attacks are considered important an honest attack would be an attack with full intention or a strong neutral neither pulling or pushing grab or hold the speed of an attack may vary depending on the experience and level of the nage the partner who executes the throw or technique whether the attack is
fast or slow the uke s intention to strike or control if grabbing or pinning should remain in order to provide the nage a realistic training scenario
aikido attacks used in normal training include various stylized strikes and grabs such as shomenuchi a vertical strike to the head yokomenuchi a lateral strike to the side of the head and or neck munetsuki a straight punch ryotedori a two handed grab or katadori a shoulder grab many of the
uchi strikes resemble blows from a sword or other weapon kicks are sometimes used but are not usually part of basic curricula most aikido techniques can also be applied to a
response to an attack e g to a block and some schools use this as the basic form of a given class of technique beginners also tend to work with techniques executed in response to a grab grabs are considered good for basic practice because the connection with uke is very clear and strong and it is easier to feel out body mechanics and lines of force there is also the matter of atemi or strikes employed
during an aikido technique the role and importance of atemi is a matter of some debate in aikido some view atemi as strikes to vital points that can be delivered during the course of a technique s application to increase effectiveness others consider atemi to be methods of distraction particularly when aimed at the face for instance if a movement would expose the aikido practitioner to a counter blow he or she may deliver a quick strike to distract the attacker or occupy the threatening limb such a strike will also usually break the target s concentration making
them easier to throw than if they are able to focus on resisting atemi can be interpreted as not only punches or kicks but also for instance striking with a shoulder or a large part of the arm some throws are arguably effected through an unbalancing or abrupt application of atemi many sayings about atemi are attributed to morihei ueshiba although their precise
content varies considerably based on the one doing the telling weapons weapons training in aikido
usually consists of jo four foot staff bokken wooden sword and wooden or sometimes rubber tanto knife both weapons taking and weapons retention are sometimes taught to integrate the armed and unarmed aspects of aikido for example a technique done with a straight punch may be done with a tanto or jo thrust instead or a grab technique may be illustrated as a way to draw strike with a weapon while being grabbed many schools use versions of morihiro saito s weapons system
aiki jo and aiki ken the system contains solo kata with jo and paired exercises for
both jo and bokken some lineages use bokken kata derived from older sword schools also quite a few aikido teachers such as mitsugi saotome and kazuo chiba have developed their own weapons systems this is largely due to the fact that o sensei did not teach weapons to his students excepting a few clothing the
aikidogi used in aikido is similar to the keikogi used in most other modern budo arts simple trousers and a wraparound jacket usually white in some places a keikogi of karate cut is preferred in others most people use judo keikogis keikogi made specially for aikido exist but usually not in the lower price ranges many dojos insist that the sleeves are cut short to elbow length
to reduce the risk of trapped fingers and injuries in grab techniques to the wrist to the keikogi adds the traditional garment hakama wide pleated trousers the hakama is usually black or dark blue and in most dojos the hakama is reserved for practitioners with dan black belt ranks systems also exist where hakama is never worn or are worn from a specific kyu rank others exist where women are allowed to wear it earlier than men the belt obi is wrapped twice around the
body similar to in karate or judo although some systems use many belt colours similar to the system in judo the most common version is that dan ranks wear black belt and kyu ranks white sometimes with an additional brown belt for the highest kyu ranks in some dojos it is common to have the same color belt at different levels spirituality the ending do in the word aikido indicates a spiritual path unlike the ending jutsu in the word aikijujutsu which indicates a system of techniques many people see this difference as important as well as regarding iaijutsu and
iaido jujutsu and judo and kenjutsu and kendo others see this distinction as a historically incorrect
and somewhat unnatural division for example literally do refers to a path and jitsu to a technique therefore some argue aikido involves both a way do and technical study jutsu ueshiba taught that
while it was important to become proficient in physical technique this is not the ultimate purpose of training he taught that the principles learned through training in physical technique are universal and are to be applied
to all aspects of one s life he once commented that he was teaching students not how to move their feet but rather how to move their minds many agree that ueshiba s style became softer more fluid and effortless as he grew older some suggest this was due to a shift in focus to the spiritual aspects of the art while others suggest that this was simply a natural result of ueshiba becoming
more proficient in physical technique various interpretations have arisen since ueshiba s death a range of aikido schools can be found each placing a different emphasis on physical techniques underlying principles and spiritual concepts this is largely a result of at what point the founder of each of these schools trained with ueshiba earlier or later in ueshiba s life the former tend to focus more on physical technique while
the latter tend to focus more on spiritual concepts however this should not be overstated especially since there is considerable variance from sensei to sensei and an aikido continuum is quite problematic to actually construct some aikidoka view physical vs spiritual as a false separation or a failed attempt to stereotype branches of aikido ki society is an example of a school that focuses heavily on the spiritual concepts of aikido rather than physical technique ki obsolete form of the ki kanji the japanese character for ki is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full
of rice the steam being contained within is ki this same word is applied to the ability to harness one s own breath power power
or energy this ki is the same as the qi in qi gong but many people argue it is not the same as the chi in t ai chi when aikidoka say that someone is training with a lot of ki they usually want to express that the person is very non forcefully compelling in the execution of his
technique timing a sense for the correct distance and a centered undisturbed mind and body are particularly important most teachers claim to locate ki in the hara which might be loosely defined as the body s center of gravity situated in the lower abdomen about two inches below and behind the navel in training it is constantly emphasized that one should keep one s hara that is remain centered very
high ranking teachers sometimes reach a level of coordination that enables them to
execute techniques with very little apparent movement sometimes even without seeming to touch their opponent s body essentially ki corresponds to the physical concepts of center of gravity center of momentum and center of force however these centers are not necessarily the same so ki also encompasses the biological and mental aspect of training oneself to have exquisite control over motion the spiritual interpretation of ki depends very much on what school of aikido one studies as some emphasize it more than others ki society dojos for example tend to spend much more time on ki related
training activities than do for example yoshinkan dojos the importance of ki in aikido cannot be denied the name of the martial art after all can be translated as the meeting of ki but what ki is is debated by many within the discipline o sensei himself appears to have changed his views over time for example yoshinkan aikido which largely follows o sensei s teachings from before the war is considerably more martial in nature reflecting a younger more violent and less spiritual o sensei within this school ki perhaps could
be better thought of as having its original chinese meaning of breath and aikido as coordination of movement with breath to maximize power as o sensei evolved and his views changed his teachings took on a much more ethereal feel and many of his later students almost all now high ranking senseis within the aikikai teach about ki from this perspective see also qi qigong body aikido training is for all around physical fitness flexibility and relaxation the human body in general can exert power in two ways
contractive and expansive aikidofaq com many fitness activities for example weight lifting emphasize the former which means that specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone mass and power the disadvantage of this however is that whole body movement and coordination are rarely stressed thus while muscle size and power may increase there is no emphasis on the ways in which those muscles can work together most efficiently
also this sort of training tends to increase tension decrease flexibility and stress the joints the result may be aesthetically pleasing but when done to excess may actually be detrimental to overall health the second type of power expansive is mostly stressed in activities such as dance or gymnastics in these activities the body must learn to move in a coordinated manner and with relaxation aikido also mostly stresses this sort of training
while both types of power are important it is interesting to note that a person who masters the second type of power can
in a martial context often overcome a person who is much bigger or stronger
the reason for this is that the contractive power is only as great as the mass and power of your individual muscles expansive power however as used in aikido can be much greater than your size may lead you to believe this is because you move with your whole body rather than stressing and tensing only a few muscles you learn to relax and move from the center of your body where you are most powerful power is then extended
out naturally through the relaxed limbs which become almost whip like in their motion needless to say the power behind an entire person s body will be more than that
of someone s arm or leg alone hence aikido develops the body in a unique manner aerobic fitness is obtained through vigorous training flexibility of the joints and connective tissues is developed through various stretching
exercises and through the techniques themselves relaxation is learned automatically since without it the techniques will not function a balanced use of contractive and expansive power is mastered enabling even a small person to pit his entire body s energy against their opponent with this different masters stress different aspects of training some masters stress importance of body posture while executing the technique in order to coordinate different parts of the body while others deal with the physical aspects of
it with each way comes a different means of interpretation of the same basic
principles of the art which is discussed in more detail above mind aikido training does not consider the body and mind as independent entities the condition of one affects the other for example the physical relaxation learned in aikido also becomes
a mental relaxation likewise the confidence that develops mentally is manifested in a more confident style psychological or spiritual insight learned during training must become reflected in the body else it will vanish under pressure when more basic ingrained patterns and reflexes take over aikido training requires the student to squarely face conflict not to run away from it through this experience an aikido student
may learn to face other areas of life in a similarly proactive fashion rather than in with avoidance and fear styles the major styles of aikido each have their own hombu dojo in japan have an international breadth and were
founded by direct students of morihei ueshiba although there has been an explosion of independent styles generally only the first five listed
have been considered major iwama ryu is a debatable sixth as although its influence is major it has until recently
been part of the aikikai see below aikikai is the largest aikido organisation and is led by the family of the founder numerous sub organisations and teachers affiliate themselves with this umbrella organisation which therefore encompasses a wide variety of aikido styles training methods and technical differences these sub organisations
are often centred around prominant shihan and are usually organised at the national level although sub national and inter national sub organisations exist please see list of famous aikidoka for more detail yoshinkan founded by gozo shioda has a reputation for being the most rigidly
precise students of yoshinkan aikido practise basic movements as solo kata and this style has been popular among the japanese police the international organization associated with the yoshinkan style of aikido is known as the yoshinkai and has active branches in many parts of the world yoseikan was founded by minoru mochizuki who was an early student of o sensei and also of jigoro kano at the kodokan this style includes elements of aiki budo together with aspects of karate judo and other arts it is now carried on by his
son hiroo mochizuki the creator of yoseikan budo shodokan aikido often called tomiki aikido after its founder use sparring and rule based competition in training as opposed to most others people tend to compete to train rather than to train to compete kenji tomiki an early student of o sensei and also of judo s jigoro kano believed that introducing an element of competition would serve to sharpen and focus the practice since it was no longer tested in real combat this latter view was the cause of a split with
o sensei s family who firmly believed that there was no place for competition in aikido training tomiki said that at no point did o sensei actually cast him out the ki society founded by former head instructor of the hombu dojo one zero th dan koichi tohei emphasizes very soft flowing techniques and has a special program for the development
of ki it also has a special system of ki ranks alongside the traditional kyu and dan system this style is called shin shin toitsu aikido or ki aikido iwama ryu emphasizes the relation between weapon techniques and barehand techniques and a great deal of emphasis is placed on weapons training
since the death of its founder morihiro saito the iwama style has been practiced by clubs within the aikikai and an independent organization headed by hitohiro saito saito sensei was a long time uchideshi of o sensei beginning in one nine four six and staying with him through his death many consider that saito sensei was the student who spent most time directly studying with o sensei saito sensei said he was trying to preserve and teach the art exactly as the founder of aikido taught it to him
technically iwama ryu seems to resemble the aikido o sensei was teaching in the early five zero s mainly in the iwama dojo the technical repertoire is fairly large the new separate from aikikai iwama ryu aikido has been renamed iwama shin shin aikishurenkai shin ei taido founded by the late noriaki inoue nephew of morihei ueshiba yoshokai aikido begun by then hachidan takashi kushida of yoshinkan aikido is a remarkably centralized style of aikido with test techniques yearly passed down with explanations from the home

the creative impulse that is art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity by biological drive or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation by both definitions of the word artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art the creative arts are a collection of disciplines whose principal purpose is in the output of material that is compelled by
a personal drive and echoes or reflects a message mood and symbolism for the viewer to interpret as such the term art may be taken to include forms as diverse as prose writing poetry dance acting music sculpture and painting in addition to serving as a method of pure creativity and self
expression the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically religiously and philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics and fine art or pleasure or to generate strong emotions the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent as a form of cultural expression art may be defined by the pursuit of diversity and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration i e art history art criticism and art theory to mediate its boundaries this distinction may be applied to objects or performances current or historical and its prestige extends to
those who made found exhibit or own them other than originality there are no widely agreed upon criteria for what is or isn t considered art
and there are many divergent definitions of art to seek more specific requirements etymology the word
art derives from the latin ars which roughly translates to skill or craft and derives in turn from an indo european root meaning arrangement or to arrange this is the only near universal definition of art that whatever is described as such has undergone a deliberate process of arrangement by an agent
a few examples where this meaning proves very broad include artifact artificial artifice artillery medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymological roots art forms there are a variety of arts including visual arts and design decorative arts plastic arts and the performing arts artistic expression takes many forms painting drawing printmaking sculpture music literature and architecture are the most widely recognised
forms however since the advent of modernism and the technological revolution new forms have emerged these include photography film video art installation art conceptual art performance art community arts land art fashion comics computer art anime and most recently video games within each form a wide range of genres may exist for instance a painting may be a still life a portrait or a landscape and may deal with historical or domestic subjects in addition a work of art may be representational or abstract
most forms of art fit under two main categories fine arts and applied arts though there is no clear dividing line in the visual arts the term fine arts most often refers to painting and sculpture arts which have little or no practical function and are valued in terms of the visual pleasure they provide or their success in communicating ideas or feelings other visual arts typically designated as fine arts include printmaking drawing photography film and video though the tools used to
realize these media are often used to make applied or commercial art as well architecture typically confounds the distinctions between fine and applied art since the form involves designing structures that strive to be both attractive and functional the term applied arts is most often used to describe the design or decoration of functional objects to make them visually pleasing artists who create applied arts or crafts are usually referred to as designers artisans or craftspeople defining art there is often confusion about the meaning of the term art because multiple meanings of the word
are used interchangeably individuals use the word art to identify painting as well as singing characteristics of art there
follow some generally accepted characteristics of art after this there is some lengthier discussion of several
of those facets perceived as universal or central to art encourages an intuitive understanding rather than a rational understanding as for example with an article in a scientific journal was created with the intention of evoking such an understanding or an attempt at such an understanding
in the audience was created with no other purpose or function other than to be itself a radical pure art definition elusive in that the work may communicate on many different levels of appreciation one may take the example of gericault s raft
of the medusa in the case of which special knowledge
concerning the shipwreck the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it but allows the appreciation of gericault s political intentions in the piece in relation to the above the piece may offer itself to many different interpretations or though it superficially depicts a mundane event or object invites reflection upon elevated themes demonstrates a high level of ability or fluency within a medium this characteristic might be considered a point of contention since many modern artists most notably conceptual artists do
not themselves create the works they conceive or do not even create the work in a conventional demonstrative sense one might think of tracey emin s controversial my bed the conferral of a particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structure or form upon an original set of unrelated passive constituents skill art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium an
example of this is the contemporary young master josignacio creator of plastic paint medium it can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language so as to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth a common view is that the epithet art particular in its elevated sense requires a certain level of
creative expertise by the artist whether this be a demonstration of technical ability such as one might find in many works of the rennaissance or in the plays of shakespeare or an originality in stylistic approach or a combination of these two for example a common contemporary criticism of some modern painting occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic
object one might take tracey emin s my bed or hirst s the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living as examples of pieces wherein the artist exercised little to no traditionally recognised sets of skills in the first case emin simply slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in
a gallery she has however been insistent that there is a high degree of selection and arrangement in this work which includes objects such as underwear and bottles around the bed in the second case hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork although he physically particpated in the creation of this piece
he has left the eventual creation of many other works to employed artisans these approaches are exemplary of a particular
kind of contemporary art conceptual art the exclusionary view that art requires a certain skill level to produce is often described as a lay critique it derives from the fact that in western culture at least art has traditionally been pushed in the direction of representationalism the literal presentation of reality through literal images on the other hand criticism has often been brought to bear on modern artists for having no
creative involvement whatsoever in their creations one might take hirst s work again as emblematic of this approach it may be further noted that certain forms of art outside a western tradition such as islamic geometric designs and calligraphy buddhist or hindu mandalas and celtic knotwork though they are non
representational still require a measure of skill and certain creative involvement in their execution judgments of value somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used
to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the
term its flavor of subjectivity making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism at the simplest level a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art whether it is perceived to be attractive or repellent though perception is always colored by experience and thus a reaction to art on these grounds
is necessarily subjective it is commonly taken that that which is not aesthetically satisfying in some fashion cannot be art however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers in other words an artist s prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic and art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thought provoking reasons for example francisco goya s painting depicting the spanish shootings of three rd of may one eight zero eight
is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goya s keen artistic ability in composition and execution and his fitting social and political outrage thus the debate continues as to what
mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of that which is aesthetically appealing indeed the reverse is often true that in the revision
of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility and a new appreciation for
the standards of art itself countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium in order to strike some universal chord or by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist communicating emotion art appeals to human emotions it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood
as a way of communicating these feelings artists have to express themselves so that their public is aroused but they do not have to do so consciously art explores what is
commonly termed as the human condition that is essentially what it is
to be human and art of a superior kind often brings about some new insight concerning humanity not always positive or demonstrates a level of skill so fine as to push forward the boundaries of collective human ability this is not to say that technical skill is a necessary prerequisite of art but rather that a high degree of skill goes some way in conferring a judgement of high
standard upon an artist or artwork creative impulse from one perspective art is a generic term for any product of the creative impulse out of which sprang
all other human pursuits such as science via alchemy and religion via shamanism the term art offers no true definition besides those based within the cultural historical and geographical context in which it is
applied though to the artists themselves the impulse to create is undeniable an artist can no more deny that impulse than he she could ignore breathing one might compare kandinsky s inner necessity to this popular view it is because of the overbearing need to create in the face of financial ruin
public obscurity or political opposition that artists are typically conceived of as unstable even crazy or misguided differences in defining art definitions of art and aesthetic arguments usually proceed from one of several possible perspectives art may be defined by the intention of the artist as in the writings of dewey art may be seen as being in the response emotion of the viewer as tolstoy claims in danto s view it can be defined as a
character of the item itself or as a function of an object s context plato for plato art is a pursuit whose adherents are not to be trusted given
that their productions imitate the sensory world itself an imitation of the divine world of forms art necessarily is an imitation of an imitation and thus is hopelessly far from the source of the truth plato it may be noted barred artists from access to his ideal city in his republic aristotle aristotle saw art in less of a bad light though he shared plato s poor opinion of it he nevertheless thought that art might serve the purpose of emotional catharsis that is by witnessing the sufferings and celebrations
of actors onstage onlookers might vicariously experience these same feelings themselves and thereby purge such negative feelings institutional definition many people s opinions of what art is would fall inside a relatively small range of accepted standards or institutional definition of art george dickie one nine seven four this derives from education and other social factors most people
did not consider the depiction of a brillo box or a store bought urinal to be art until andy warhol and marcel duchamp respectively placed them in the context of art i e the art gallery which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art although strictly speaking warhol s artwork was not an actual brillo box but an exact replica of one so it met the traditional criterion of skill at the very least most viewers of these objects initially rejected such associations because the objects did not themselves
meet the accepted criteria the objects needed to be absorbed into the general consensus of what art is before they achieved the near universal acceptance as art in the contemporary era once accepted and viewed with a fresh eye the smooth white surfaces of duchamp s urinal are strikingly similar to classical marble sculptural
forms whether the artist intended it or not this type of recontextualizing
provides the same spark of connection expected from any traditionally created art it should be noted however that duchamps act might be as readily interpreted as a demonstration of the not always beneficial power of artistic institutions rather than the universal art potentially inherent in all objects the placement of an object in an artistic context is not taken as a universal standard of art but is a common characteristic of conceptual art prevalent since the one nine six zero s notably the stuckist art movement criticises this tendency
of recent art related issues social criticism art is often seen as belonging to one social
class and excluding others in this context art is seen as a high status activity associated with wealth the ability to purchase art and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it the palaces of versailles
or the hermitage in st petersburg with their vast collections of art amassed by the fabulously wealthy royalty of europe exemplify this view collecting such art is the preserve of the rich in one viewpoint before the one three th century in europe artisans were considered to belong to a lower caste since they were essentially manual labourers after europe was re exposed to classical culture during the renaissance particularly in the nation states of what is now italy florence siena artists gained an association
with high status however arrangements of fine and expensive goods have always been used by institutions of power as marks of their own status this is seen in the two zero th and two one st century by the commissioning or purchasing of art by big businesses and corporations as decoration for their offices utility there are many who ascribe
to certain arts the quality of being non utilitarian this fits within the art as good system of definitions and suffers from a class prejudice against labor and utility opponents of this view argue that all human activity has some utilitarian function and these objects claimed to be non utilitarian actually have the rather mundane and banal utility of attempting to mystify and codify unworkable justifications for arbitrary social hierarchy
it might also be argued that non utilitarian is in this context a mis usage that art is not in and of
itself useless but rather that it particularly use does not manifest itself in any traditionally demonstrable way though advances in neuroscience may arguably enable the isolation of those associated cortices of the brain concerned with the creation or appreciation of art art is also used by art therapists and some psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy the end product is not the principal goal in this case rather a process of healing through creative acts is sought the resultant
piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced
by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy the use of art from the artist s standpoint is as a means of expression when art is conceived as a device it serves several context and perspective specific functions from the artist s perspective it allows one to symbolize complex ideas and emotions in an arbitrary language subject only to the interpretation of the self and peers in a social context it can serve to soothe the soul and promote popular
morale in a more negative aspect of this facet art is often utilised as a form of propaganda and thus can
be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood in some cases artworks are appropriated to be used in this manner without the creator s initial intention from a more anthropological perspective art is a way of passing ideas and concepts on to later generations in a somewhat universal language the interpretation of this language is very dependent upon the observer
s perspective and context and it might be argued that the very subjectivity of art demonstrates its importance in providing
an arena in which rival ideas might be exchanged and discussed or to provide a social context in which disparate groups of people might congregate and mingle history of art the term art history typically refers to a historical examination of the various trends of the visual arts
through certain periods of human history it may also be taken to encompass a study of the theories of art
which may or may not include an examination of their historical context symbols much of the development of individual artist deals with finding principles for how to express certain ideas through various kinds of symbolism for example vasily kandinsky developed his use of color in painting through a system of stimulus response where over time he gained an understanding of the emotions that can be evoked by color and combinations of color contemporary artist andy goldsworthy on the other hand chose to
use the medium of found natural objects and materials to arrange temporary sculptures cultural differences of art several genres of art are grouped by cultural relevance examples can be found in terms such as african art american craft islamic art asian art as found in buddhist art chinese art japanese art tibetan art thai art laotian art visual arts of the united states latin american art see also aesthetics the philosophy of beauty art criticism art groups art history art sale art school art styles periods and movements

location filming an actor is a person who acts or plays a role in an artistic production the term commonly refers to someone working in
movies television live theatre or radio and can occasionally denote a street entertainer besides playing dramatic roles actors may also sing or dance or work only on radio or as a voice artist a female actor may be known as an actress although the term actor is also used as a gender neutral term
an actor usually plays a fictional character in the case of a true story or a fictional story that portrays real people an actor may play a real
person or a fictional version of the same occasionally actors appear as themselves etymology actor is directly from the masculine latin noun actor feminine actrix from the verb agere to do to drive to pass time the suffix or so st who performs the action indicated by the stem alternatively from greek aktor leader from the verb ag to lead or carry to convey to bring history the first recorded case of an actor performing took place in five three four bc probably on two
three november though the changes in calendar over the years make it
hard to determine exactly when the greek performer thespis stepped on to the stage at the theatre dionysus and became the first person to speak words as a character in a play the machinations of storytelling were immediately revolutionized prior to thespis act stories were told in song and dance and in third person narrative but
no one had assumed the role of a character in a story in honour of thespis actors are commonly called thespians theatrical myth to this day maintains that thespis exists as a mischievous spirit and disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his ghostly intervention actors were traditionally not people of high status and in the early middle ages travelling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust however this negative perception dramaticaly changed in two zero th century as acting became an honored and popular profession and art part of the reason
is due to the rise of the popular appeal and access to dramatic film entertainment and the resulting rise of the movie star in social status and the large salaries they commanded the combination of public presence and wealth had a profound rehabilitation to the
image in the past only men could become actors in the ancient and medieval world it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage and this belief continued right up until the one seven th century when in venice it was broken in the time of william shakespeare women s roles were played by men or boys though there is some evidence to suggest that women disguised as men also illegally
performed actors playing the opposite sex women sometimes play the roles of prepubescent boys because in some regards a woman has a closer resemblance to a boy than does a man the role of peter pan for example is traditionally played by a woman the tradition of the principal boy in pantomime may be compared an adult playing a child occurs more in theater than in film the exception to this is voice actors in animated films where boys are generally voiced by women as
heard in the simpsons opera has several pants roles traditionally sung by women usually mezzo sopranos examples are hansel in h nsel und gretel and cherubino in the marriage of figaro mary pickford played the part of little lord fauntleroy in the first film version of the book
linda hunt won an academy award for best supporting actress in the year of living dangerously in which she played the part of a man having an actor play the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long standing tradition in comic theatre and film most of shakespeare s comedies include instances of cross dressing and both dustin hoffman and robin williams appeared in hit comedy films where they were required to play most scenes dressed as women tony curtis and jack lemmon famously posed as women to
escape gangsters in the billy wilder film some like it hot techniques of acting actors employ a variety of
techniques that are learned through training and experience some of these are the rigorous use of the voice to communicate a character s lines and express emotion this is achieved through attention to diction and projection through correct breathing and articulation it is also achieved through the tone and emphasis that an actor puts on words physicalisation of a role in order to create a believable character for the audience and to use the acting space appropriately and correctly use of gesture to complement the voice interact with other actors and to bring
emphasis to the words in a play as well as having symbolic meaning shakespeare is believed to have been commenting on the acting style and techniques of his era when hamlet gives his famous advice

middle cambrian the last agnostids held out until the late ordovician the agnostida are divided into two suborders agnostina and eodiscina that are then divided
into a number of families the eodiscina appear to be normal trilobites with only
two or three segments in the thorax some resemble trilobites of the order ptychopariida as a group agnostids have pygidia tails that are similar in size and shape to their cephalons heads neither looks
much like the corresponding regions of other trilobites there has been more than one argument about which end is the head agnostids were probably benthic bottom dwelling creatures most agnostid species have no eyes they likely lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom unfortunately the appendages are known only for one genus of agnostid
the legs of that genus look much more like crustacean legs than the legs of other trilobites with preserved appendages this has caused many taxonomists to question whether the agnostids are truly trilobites another view is that the agnostids represent the first line to have diverged from the trilobites however four orders of trilobites redlichiida corynexochida

fact sheet a guide to the eight orders of trilobites by sam gon iii prehistoric arthropods an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an embryo or a fetus this can occur spontaneously in the form of a miscarriage or be intentionally induced through chemical surgical
or other means generally abortions are performed by gynaecologists or obstetricians all mammalian pregnancies can be aborted however this article focuses exclusively on the abortion of human pregnancy there have been various methods of inducing an abortion throughout the centuries in the two zero th century
the ethics and morality of abortion became the subject of intense political debate in many areas of the world definitions pregnancy is defined by the medical community as beginning at the implantation of the embryo others differ however placing this initiation at conception
the following medical terms are used to define an abortion spontaneous abortion miscarriage an abortion due to accidental trauma or natural causes induced abortion an abortion deliberately caused induced abortions are further subcategorized into therapeutic abortions and elective abortions therapeutic abortion to save the life of the pregnant woman to preserve the woman s physical or mental health to terminate a pregnancy that would result
in the birth of a child with defects which would be incompatible with life or associated with significant morbidity to selectively reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy to lessen health risks involved elective
abortion an abortion performed for any other reason methods of birth control that prevent implantation such as emergency contraception are not considered to be abortion however emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who reject the medical definition of pregnancy a pregnancy that ends earlier than three seven completed weeks of gestation and where an infant is born and survives is termed a premature birth a pregnancy that ends with an
infant dead upon birth at any gestational stage due to causes including spontaneous abortion or complications during delivery is termed a stillbirth in common parlance the term abortion is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus incidence the incidence of and reasons for induced abortion vary in regions in which abortion is generally permitted it has been estimated that the total number of induced abortions performed globally is approximately four six million per year two six million of these are said to occur in places in which abortion is legal the other two zero million happen where it is
illegal some countries such as belgium and the netherlands experience a low rate of induced abortion while others like russia and vietnam have a comparatively high rate a one nine nine eight study aggregated data from studies in two seven countries on the reasons women seek to terminate
their pregnancies it concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were the desire to delay or end childbearing concern over the interruption of work or education issues of financial or relationship stability and perceived immaturity in finland and the united
states concern for the health risks posed by pregnancy in individual cases was not a
factor commonly given whereas in bangladesh india and kenya such a concern was found to be more prevalent a two zero zero four study in which american women at clinics answered a questionnaire yielded similar results some abortions
are undergone as the result of societal pressures such as eugenics the stigmatization of disabled persons preference for children of a specific sex disapproval of single motherhood insufficient economic
support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control such as china s one child policy a combination of these factors can sometimes result in forced abortion forced sterilization infanticide child abandonment or sex selective abortion and infanticide which is illegal in most countries but difficult to stop in many areas especially in developing nations or where abortion is illegal women sometimes resort to back alley or self induced procedures the world health organization suggests that there are one
nine million terminations annually which fit its criteria for an unsafe abortion see social issues for more information on these subjects forms of abortion spontaneous abortion spontaneous abortions generally
referred to as miscarriages occur when an embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes a
miscarriage is spontaneous loss of the embryo or fetus before the two zero th week of development spontaneous abortions after the two zero th week are generally considered to be preterm deliveries most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy approximately one zero five zero of pregnancies end in miscarriage depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman the risk for spontaneous abortion is greater in those with a history of more than three previous known spontaneous abortions those who have had a previous induced abortion those with systemic diseases and in women over
age three five other causes can be infection of either the woman or the fetus immune responses or serious systemic diseases of the woman a spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma intentional trauma to cause miscarriage is considered
an induced abortion some governments have laws increasing the criminal liability of a person who causes a miscarriage during an assault or other violent crime induced abortion a pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in a number of ways the manner
selected depends chiefly upon the gestational age of the fetus in addition to the legality regional availability and or doctor patient preference for specific procedures surgical abortion u s
president george w bush signs the partial birth abortion ban act of two zero zero three in the first fifteen weeks suction aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common method manual vacuum aspiration or mva
abortion consists of removing the fetus or embryo by suction using a manual syringe while the electric vacuum aspiration or eva abortion method uses an electric pump these techniques are equivalent differing only in the mechanism use to apply suction from the fifteenth week up until around
the twenty sixth week a surgical dilation and evacuation d e is used d e consists of opening the cervix of the uterus
and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction dilation and curettage d c is a standard gynaecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy investigation of abnormal bleeding and abortion curettage refers to the cleaning of the walls of the uterus with a curette the world health organization recommends this
sort of procedure also called sharp curettage only when mva is unavailable sharp curettage only accounted for two four of abortion procedures in the us in two zero zero two the term d and c can more generally be used to refer to the first trimester abortion procedure irrespective of the method used to perform the procedure other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the third trimester premature delivery can be induced with prostaglandin this can be coupled with injecting the amniotic fluid with caustic solutions containing saline or urea very late abortions can be brought about by
intact dilation and extraction intact d x which requires the surgical decompression of the fetus s head before evacuation and is sometimes termed partial birth abortion a hysterotomy abortion similar to a caesarian section but resulting in a terminated fetus can also be used at late stages
of pregnancy it can be performed vaginally with an incision just above the cervix in the late mid trimester chemical abortion the molecular structure of the abortifacient drug mifepristone effective in the first trimester
of pregnancy chemical also referred to as a medical abortion or non surgical abortions comprise one zero of all abortions in the united states and europe the process begins with the administration of either methotrexate or mifepristone followed by misoprostol
when appropriately used nine eight of women undergoing medical termination of pregnancy will experience completed abortion without surgical intervention the food and drug administration currently approves the use of mifepristone up to four nine days gestation seven weeks though evidence based regimens exist for its use up to six one days gestation with similar success rates misoprostol alone can also be used though it is not fda approved for this purpose misoprostol cytotec alone has the advantage of costing
less than one dollar for an effective dose as opposed to several hundred dollars
for an effective dose of mifepristone in cases of failure of medical abortion vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically other means of abortion historically a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine tansy pennyroyal black cohosh and the now extinct silphium see history of abortion the use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious even lethal side effects such as multiple organ failure and is not recommended by physicians abortion is sometimes attempted through means of trauma to the abdomen the
degree of force applied if severe can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage both accidental and deliberate abortions of this kind can be subject to criminal liability in many countries in burma indonesia malaysia the philippines and thailand there is an
ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage reported methods
of unsafe self induced abortion include the misuse of the ulcer drug misoprostol and the insertion of non surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus health effects early term surgical abortion is a simple procedure and when performed by competent doctors and in some states nurse practitioners nurse
midwives and physician assistants in first world nations before the one six th week is safer than carrying the pregnancy to term as with most surgical procedures the most common surgical abortion methods carry the risk of potentially serious complications these risks include a perforated uterus perforated bowel or bladder septic shock sterility and death the risk of complications occurring can increase depending
on how far the pregnancy has progressed but may be counterbalanced by complications that would occur from carrying the pregnancy to term it is difficult to accurately assess the risks of induced abortion due to a number of factors these factors include wide variation in
the quality of abortion services in different societies and among different socio economic groups a lack of uniform definitions of terms and difficulties in patient follow up and after care the degree of risk is also dependent
upon the skill and experience of the practitioner maternal age health and parity gestational age pre existing conditions methods and instruments used medications used the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner and the quality of recovery and follow up care a highly skilled practitioner operating under ideal conditions will tend to have a very low rate of
complications an inexperienced practitioner in an ill equipped and ill staffed facility on the other hand will often have a higher incidence of complications in the united kingdom the number of deaths due to legal abortion between the years of one nine nine one and one nine nine three was five as compared to the nine deaths caused by ectopic pregnancy during the same time frame in the united states during the year one nine nine nine there were a total of
four deaths due to legal abortion some practitioners advocate using minimal anesthesia so that
the patient can alert them to possible complications others recommend general anesthesia in order to prevent patient movement which might cause a perforation general anesthesia carries its own risks including death which is
why public health officials recommend against its routine use dilation of the cervix carries the risk of cervical tears or perforations including small tears that might not be apparent and might cause cervical incompetence in future pregnancies most practitioners recommend using the smallest possible dilators and using osmotic rather than mechanical dilators after the first
trimester of pregnancy instruments are placed within the uterus to remove the fetus these can on rare occasions cause perforation or laceration of the uterus and damage to structures surrounding the uterus laceration or perforation of the uterus or cervix can again on rare occasions lead to even more serious complications incomplete emptying of the uterus can cause hemorrhage and infection use of ultrasound verification of the location and duration of the pregnancy prior to abortion with immediate follow up of patients reporting continuing pregnancy symptoms after the procedure will virtually eliminate this risk the sooner a complication is noted
and properly treated the lower the risk of permanent injury or death in rare cases the abortion will be unsuccessful and the pregnancy will continue an unsuccessful abortion can also result in the delivery of a live neonate or infant this termed a failed abortion is more likely to occur if the procedure is carried out later in the pregnancy some doctors faced with this situation have voiced concerns about the ethical and
legal ramifications of then letting the neonate die as a result recent investigations have been launched in the united kingdom by the confidential enquiry into maternal and child health cemach and the
royal college of obstetricians and gynecologists in order to determine how widespread the problem is and what an ethical response in the treatment of the infant might be
use of other methods e g overdose of various drugs insertion of various objects into uterus for abortion is potentially dangerous carrying a significantly elevated risk for permanent injury or death compared to abortions done by physicians suggested effects there is controversy over a number of proposed risks and effects of abortion evidence whether in support of or against such claims might in part be influenced by the political and religious beliefs of the parties behind it breast cancer the abortion breast cancer abc hypothesis posits a causal relationship between
having an induced abortion and a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the future an increased level of estrogen in early pregnancy helps to initiate cellular differentiation growth in the breast in preparation for lactation if this process
is terminated through abortion before full differentiation in the third trimester then more vulnerable undifferentiated cells will be left than there were prior to the pregnancy it is proposed that this might result in an elevated risk of breast cancer the majority of interview based studies have indicated a link and some have been demonstrated to be statistically significant but there remains debate as to their reliability because of possible response
bias larger and more recent record based studies such as one in one nine nine seven which used data from two national registries in denmark found the correlation to be negligible to non existent after statistical adjustment the national cancer institute conducted an official workshop with dozens of experts on the issue between
february two four february two six two zero zero three which concluded from its examination of various evidence that it is well
established that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk these findings
and how the denmark study statistically adjusted their overall results have been disputed by dr joel brind an invitee to the workshop and the leading scientific advocate of the abortion breast cancer hypothesis nevertheless gaps and inconsistencies remain in the research and the subject continues to be one of political and scientific contention fetal pain the experience of the fetus during abortion is a matter of medical ethical and public policy concern evidence is conflicting with some authorities holding that the fetus is capable of feeling pain from the first trimester and others
maintaining that the neuro anatomical requirements for such experience do not exist until the second or third trimester pain receptors begin to appear in the seventh week of pregnancy the thalamus the part of the brain which receives signals from the nervous system and then relays them to the cerebral cortex starts to form in the fifth week however other anatomical structures involved in the nociceptic process are not present until much later in gestation links between the thalamus and cerebral cortex aren t forged until around the two three
rd week researchers have observed changes in the heart rates and hormonal levels of newborn infants after circumcision blood tests and surgery effects which were alleviated with the administration of anesthesia others suggest that the human experience of pain being more than just
physiological cannot be measured in such reflexive responses mental health some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion however whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis or even classification as an independent syndrome see post abortion syndrome is a subject that is debated among members of the medical community data on the incidence of clinical depression mental illness post traumatic stress disorder and suicide in association with abortion remain inconclusive a comparative analysis of the suicide rates among postpartum and post abortive
women in finland found a statistical correlation between abortion and suicide other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted pregnancy and an improvement in reported mental well being elective abortion may reduce the occurrence of depression in cases of unwanted pregnancy as compared to
cases in which the pregnancy has been carried to completion but it is also sometimes reported as an additional stressor ibid the majority of evidence would seem to indicate that adverse emotional reactions to the procedure are most strongly influenced by pre existing
psychological conditions and other negative factors ibid spontaneous abortion or miscarriage is known to present an increased risk of depression in women history of abortion bottom most dr caton s tansy pills an example of a clandestine advertisement the practice of induced abortion according to some anthropologists can be traced to ancient times there is
evidence to suggest that historically pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods including the administration of abortifacient herbs the use of sharpened implements the application of abdominal pressure and other techniques soranus a two nd century greek physician suggested in his work gynecology that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise energetic jumping carrying heavy objects and riding animals he also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal bathes pessaries and bloodletting but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ perforation it
is also known that the ancient greeks relied upon the herb silphium as both a contraceptive and an abortifacient the plant as the chief export of cyrene was driven to extinction but it is suggested that it might have possessed the
same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the apiaceae family such folk remedies however varied in effectiveness and were not without risk tansy and pennyroyal for example are two poisonous herbs with serious side effects that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy one nine th century medicine saw advances in the fields of surgery anaesthesia and sanitation in the same era that doctors with the
american medical association lobbied for bans on abortion in the united states and the british parliament passed the offences against the person act demand for the procedure continued however as the disguised but nonetheless open advertisement
of abortion services in victorian times would seem to suggest social issues a number of of complex issues exist in the debate over abortion these like the suggested effects upon health listed above are a
focus of research and a fixture of discussion among members on all sides the controversy effect upon crime rate a controversial theory attempts to draw a correlation between the unprecedented
nationwide decline of the overall crime rate witnessed in the united states during the one nine nine zero s and the decriminalization of abortion two zero years prior the suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a one nine nine nine academic paper the impact of legalized abortion on crime authored by the economists steven d levitt and john donohue they attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes unwanted children especially those
born to mothers who are african american impoverished adolescent uneducated and single the change coincided with what would ve been the adolescence or peak years of potential criminality of those who had not been born as a result of roe v wade and similar cases donohue and levitt s study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate
pattern earlier and that those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions fellow economists christopher foote and christopher goetz criticized the methodology in the donahue levitt study noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita they found no statistically significant results levitt and donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted data set which took into account these concerns but they claim maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper such research has been criticized by some as
being utilitarian discriminatory as to race and socioeconomic class and as promoting eugenics as a solution to crime levitt states in his book freakonomics that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action merely reporting data as economists sex selective abortion the advent of both ultrasound and amniocentesis has allowed parents to determine sex before birth this has lead to the
occurrence of sex selective abortion or the targeted termination of a fetus based upon its gender it is suggested that sex selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some places the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia and the use of abortion to limit female births has been reported
in mainland china taiwan south korea and india in india the economic role of men the costs associated with dowries and a hindu tradition which dictates that funeral rites must be performed by a male relative have lead to a cultural preference for sons the widespread availability of diagnostic testing during the one nine seven zero s and eight zero s lead to advertisements for
services which read invest five zero zero rupees for a sex test now save five zero zero zero zero rupees for a dowry later in one nine nine one the male to female sex ratio in india was skewed from its biological norm of one zero five to one zero zero to an average of one zero eight to one zero zero researchers have asserted that between one nine eight five and two zero zero five as many as one zero million female fetuses may have been selectively aborted the indian government passed an official ban of

a complete ban of sex selective abortion in two zero zero two in the people s republic of china there is also a historic son preference the implementation of the one child policy in one nine seven nine in response to population concerns lead to an increased disparities in the sex ratio as parents attempted to circumvent the law through sex selective abortion or the abandonment of unwanted daughters sex selective abortion might be a part of what is

women seeking to terminate their pregnancies have sometimes resorted to unsafe methods back alley abortion is a slang term for any abortion not practiced under ideal conditions of sanitation and professionalism the world health organization defines an unsafe abortion as being a procedure carried out by persons lacking
the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards or both this can include a person without medical training a professional health provider operating in sub standard conditions or the woman herself unsafe abortion remains a
public health concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications such as incomplete abortion sepsis hemorrhage and damage to internal organs who estimates that one nine million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that six eight zero zero zero of these result in the death of a woman complications of unsafe abortion are said to account globally for approximately one three of all maternal mortalities with regional estimates including one two in asia two five in
latin america and one three in sub saharan africa health education access to family planning and improvements in healthcare during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon abortion debate pro life activists in washington dc stage a silent demonstration before the supreme court over the course of the history of abortion induced abortions have been a source of considerable debate and controversy regarding the morality and legality of this practice an individual s position on the complex ethical moral philosophical biological and legal issues have
a strong relationship with that individual s value system a person s position on abortion may be best described as a combination of their personal beliefs on the morality of abortion and that person s beliefs on the ethical scope and responsibility of legitimate governmental and legal authority another factor for many individuals is religious doctrine
see religion and abortion abortion debates especially pertaining to abortion laws are often spearheaded by advocacy groups belonging to one of two camps most often those in favor of legal prohibition of abortion describe themselves as pro life while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as pro choice both are used to indicate the central principles in arguments for and against abortion is the fetus
a human being with a fundamental right to life for pro life advocates and for those who are pro choice does a woman have the right to choose whether or not to have an
abortion in both public and private debate arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion arguments on morality and legality tend to collide and combine complicating the issue at hand debate also focuses on whether the pregnant woman should have to notify and or have the consent of others in distinct cases a minor her parents a legally married or common law wife her husband

opposing team s end zone and score points the ball can be advanced by carrying the ball or by throwing
or handing it from one teammate to the other points can be scored in a variety of ways including carrying the ball over the goal line throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or kicking it through the goal posts the winner is the team with the most points when the time expires outside of the united states and a few
other countries such as american samoa the sport is usually referred to as american football or sometimes as gridiron to differentiate it from other football games especially association football soccer and rugby football american football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late one nine th century arena football is a variant of american football in canada the unqualified term football typically refers to canadian football a game which is a close relative of american
football but different in several respects popularity since the one nine six zero s football has surpassed baseball as the most popular spectator sport in the united states the three two team national football league nfl is the most popular and only major professional american football league its championship game the super bowl is watched by nearly
half of us television households and is also televised in over one five zero other countries super bowl sunday has become an annual ritual in late january or early february football is also the most watched sport on television in the us the nfl also operates a developmental league nfl europe with six teams based in european cities a colorado state university player runs with the ball as an air force academy player lines up

school football games can attract five figure crowds especially in hotbeds like western pennsylvania nebraska florida georgia and most especially texas ohio and california the weekly autumn ritual of college and high school football which includes marching bands cheerleaders and parties
including the ubiquitous tailgate party is an important part of the culture in much of smalltown america it is a long standing tradition in the united states though not universally observed that high school football games are played on friday college games on saturday and professional games on sunday with an additional professional game on monday nights see monday night football it is often said of an outstanding college football player that he is likely to be playing on sundays one day meaning that he is a good pro prospect certain fall and winter holidays
most notably thanksgiving christmas and new years day have traditional football games associated with them football is also played recreationally by amateur club and youth teams e g the pop warner little league programs there are also many semi pro teams in leagues where the players are paid to play but at a small enough salary that they generally must also hold a full time job pro football is played only in the united states and in the above mentioned nfl europe league the sport is popular as an amateur activity in mexico and
american samoa and to a lesser extent in japan europe and australia a very similar sport canadian football is widely played in canada organized football is played almost exclusively by men and boys although a few amateur and semi professional women s leagues have begun play in recent years the rules of american football the object of american football is to score more points than the opposing team within a set time limit field and players
the numbers on the field indicate the number of yards to the nearest end zone the field is often called the gridiron because the markings on the field resemble a grill the game is played on a rectangular field
one two zero yards one one zero metres long by five three one three yards four nine metres wide the longer boundary lines are sidelines while the shorter boundary lines are end lines near each end of the field is a goal line they are one zero zero yards apart a scoring area called
an end zone extends one zero yards beyond each goal line to each end line yard lines
cross the field every five yards and are numbered from each goal line to the five zero yard line or midfield similar to a typical rugby league field two rows of lines known as hash marks parallel the side lines near the middle of the field all plays start with
the ball on or between the hash marks at the back of each end zone are two goal posts also called uprights that are one eight five feet apart the posts are connected by a crossbar one
zero feet from the ground successful kicks must go above the crossbar and between the uprights at many fields the uprights and crossbar are attached by a curved bar to a post outside the field of play to reduce the chance of players running into the supports each team
has one one players on the field at a time however teams may substitute for any or all of their players between plays as a result players have very specialized roles and almost all of the five three players on an nfl team will play in any given game thus teams are divided into three separate units the offense the defense and the special teams see below in the nfl players jersey numbers are distributed according to a strict system e g quarterbacks
always wear between one one nine game duration a standard football game consists of four one five minute typically one two minutes in high school football periods called quarters with an intermission called halftime after the second quarter the clock stops after certain plays therefore a game can last considerably longer often more than three hours in real time if an nfl game is tied after four quarters the teams play up to another one five minutes in an nfl overtime game the first team that scores wins if neither team scores the game is a tie
college overtime rules are more complicated and are described at overtime sport advancing the ball advancing the ball in american football resembles the six tackle rule and the play the ball in rugby league football the team that takes possession of the ball the offense has four attempts called downs to advance the ball one zero yards towards their opponent s the defense
s end zone when the offense gains one zero yards it gets a first down or another set of four downs to gain one zero yards if the offense fails to gain a first down one zero yards after four downs it loses possession of the ball except at the beginning of halves and after scores see kickoffs and free kicks below the ball is always put into play by a snap all players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage the position on the field where the
play begins one offensive player the center then passes or snaps the ball between his legs to a teammate usually the quarterback players can then advance the ball in two ways by running with the ball also known as rushing one ball carrier can hand the ball to another this is known as a handoff by throwing the ball to a teammate known as passing the
forward pass is a key factor distinguishing american and canadian football from other football sports the offense can throw the ball forward only once on a play and only from behind the line of scrimmage the ball can be thrown sideways or backwards at any time this type of pass is known as a lateral and is much rarer in american football than in rugby league or rugby union where a backwards pass is mandatory a play or down ends and the ball becomes dead after any of the following the player with
the ball is forced to the ground or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team as determined by an official a forward pass flies out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught this is known as an incomplete pass the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down the ball or the player with the ball goes beyond the dimensions of the field out of bounds a
team scores a certain penalty is committed such as false start that causes the play to
be blown dead and replayed officials blow a whistle to notify all players that the play is over at all times players and fans must be aware of the sequence of downs and the distance to a new first down when a team has a first down the scoreboard or television screen flashes one st and one zero
that is first down and one zero yards to go if the team gains three yards on the first play for example the next down will be two nd and seven changes of possession the offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things happens the team fails to get a first down that is move the ball forward at
least one zero yards in four downs the defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the play ends a change of
possession in this manner is commonly called a turnover on downs the offense scores a touchdown or field goal the team
that scored then kicks off the ball to the other team see scoring and kickoffs below the offense punts the ball to the defense a punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground punts are nearly always made on fourth down when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field through a failed attempt to
make a first down and feels it is too far from the other team s goal posts to kick a field goal a defensive player
catches a forward pass this is called an interception and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until tackled forced out of bounds or scores after the intercepting player is tackled or forced out of bounds his team s offensive unit returns to the field and takes over at his last
position an offensive player drops the ball a fumble and a defensive player picks it up as with interceptions a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled or forced out of bounds lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers the offensive team misses a field goal attempt the defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous
play began or in the nfl at the spot of the kick if the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within two zero yards of the end zone the other team gets the ball at its own
two zero yard line that is two zero yards from the end zone an offensive player is tackled forced out of bounds or commits certain penalties in his own end zone this rare occurrence is called a safety
see scoring below scoring a team scores points by the following plays a touchdown td is worth six points a touchdown is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent s end zone after a touchdown the scoring team attempts a conversion the ball is placed at the other team s three yard line the two yard line in the nfl the team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for one point
an extra point or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for two points a two point conversion in collegiate and professional leagues the extra point is usually preferred its success rate is nine four in the nfl and nine three eight in the ncaa compared to four three in the nfl and four three five in the ncaa for
two point conversions if the defense forces a turnover on an attempted conversion and runs the ball back to their opponent s endzone they are awarded with two points does not apply in the nfl a field goal fg is worth three points and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts field goals may be placekicked kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a
teammate or drop kicked a field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to
the goal line or when there is little or no
time left to otherwise score a safety is worth two points a safety is scored by the defense when the offensive player in possession of the ball is forced back into his own end zone and is tackled there or fumbles the ball out of the end zone certain penalties by the offense occurring in the end zone also result in a safety kickoffs and free kicks each half begins with a kickoff teams
also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals the ball is kicked from a kicking tee which is made from one s own three zero yard line in the
nfl and from the three five yard line in college football the other team s kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its drive or series of offensive plays if a kick returner does
not want to run with the ball he has the option to signal for a fair catch by waving his hands in the air before the catch he will then be allowed to catch the ball and kneel it down on the field without being tackled if the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone he can either run with the ball or elect for a
touchback by kneeling in the end zone the receiving team can then start its offensive drive from its own two zero yard line a touchback can also occur when the kick goes out of the end zone punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in touchbacks if a kickoff
goes out of bounds over the sidelines without being interfered by the receiving team the ball will be placed three zero yards from the spot of the kickoff traditionally at the
receiving team s four zero yard line in the nfl or the three five yard line in college football after safeties there is a free kick instead of a kickoff a free kick is made from a team s own two zero yard line and can be punted or
placekicked penalties rule violations are punished with penalties most penalties result in moving the football either towards the endzone in the case of a defensive penalty or away from the endzone in the
case of an offensive penalty some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down in addition if a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down the first down is automatically given if a penalty occurs during a play an official throws a yellow flag near the spot of the foul when the play is over the team that did not commit the penalty has the option of taking either the penalty or the result of the play
for example say a defensive player commits an offsides penalty on first down by passing the line of scrimmage before the snap and the offense
gains eight yards on the play the team with the ball has the option of taking the penalty and repeat the first down with five yards to go or declining the penalty and scrimmaging with two nd and two
some common penalties false start a player on the offense other than a back moving parallel to the line of scrimmage moves just prior to the snap five yards offsides a player is on the wrong side of the ball at the start of a play five yards similar fouls touching an
opponent before the snap is encroachment lining up alongside the football instead of behind it is a neutral zone infraction holding a blocker unfairly impedes a would be tackler or pass receiver by grabbing the player s jersey hooking or tackling when commited by the offense or by either team on a change of possession the penalty is ten yards when committed by the defense the penalty is five yards and an automatic first down is awarded to the offense if
the penalty occurred beyond the line of scrimmage the penalty would
be enforced from the spot of the foul pass interference after a pass is launched into the
air a defender pushes hooks grabs or knocks down a would be pass receiver or if the receiver does the same to the defender to prevent an interception first down at the spot of the foul if against the defense one five yards from the previous spot in college football or ten yards from the previous spot if against the offense similar penalties before a pass are called as holding or illegal contact facemask a player places his hand on an opponent s facemask during a play five yards or fifteen a personal foul
if the player hooks his fingers into the facemask or pulls on it roughing the passer kicker a player places a hard hit on a passer long enough after a pass has been thrown to consider the contact avoidable
or places a hard hit on a punter or place kicker fifteen yards and automatic first down running into the kicker a lighter contact on a kicker especially after the kick has been made five yards intentional grounding the passer throws a forward pass not near any eligible receiver without first leaving the area behind where the blocking linemen were standing before the snap the pocket or the passer throws a forward pass outside of the pocket which does not reach the original line of scrimmage and is not near any eligible receiver ten
yards plus loss of down except if the penalty occurred in
the end zone then it is ruled a safety and the defense is awarded two points in college football and high school football the defense is also credited with a quarterback sack note that spiking the ball to stop the clock is exempt from this ineligible receiver downfield on every play the offense must have seven players on the line of scrimmage the player furthest from the ball on each side are eligible receivers the interior five players are considered ineligible to receive passes this penalty is called if one of the
five interior players is more than five yards past the line of scrimmage during a forward pass dead ball personal foul after the play is blown dead a player tackles or makes
rough contact with a player on the other team fifteen yards automatic first down if on defense unnecessary roughness a catch all for rough play that doesn t merit its own foul an example is an avoidable late hit on a ball carrier who has run out of bounds fifteen yards unsportsmanlike conduct another catch all call commonly used for taunting excessive celebration after a touchdown and certain banned forms of pantomime like slashing the throat fifteen yards the players as
noted above most football players have highly specialized roles at the college and nfl levels most play only offense or only defense offense the offensive line consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer
and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense except for the center offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball the quarterback
receives the ball on most plays he then hands or tosses it to a running back throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself running backs line up behind or beside the qb and specialize in rushing with the ball they also block catch passes and on rare occasions pass the ball to others wide receivers line up near the sidelines they specialize in catching passes tight ends line up outside the offensive line they can either play like wide receivers try
to catch passes or like offensive linemen protect the qb or create spaces for runners not all of these types of players will be in on every offensive play teams can vary the number of wide receivers tight ends and running backs on the field at one time defense the defensive line consists of three to five players who line up across from the offensive line they try to tackle the running backs before they can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw a pass
at least three players line up as defensive backs they cover the receivers and
try to stop pass completions they occasionally rush the quarterback the other players on the defense are known as linebackers they line
up between the defensive line and backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers special teams the units of players who handle kicking plays are known as special
teams special teams feature players that include the punter who handles punts and the placekicker or kicker who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points basic football strategy to many fans the chief draw of football is the chess game that goes on between the two coaching
staffs each team has a playbook of dozens to hundreds of plays plays are the directions for what the players should do on a down some plays are very safe they are very likely to get a few yards but not much more than that other plays have the potential for long gains but a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover generally speaking rushing plays are less risky than passing plays however there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays to fool the other team there are passing plays designed to
look like running plays and vice versa there are many trick or gadget plays such as when a team lines up like it is going to kick and then tries to run or pass for a first down such high risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work however they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly it has been said that football is the closest sport that strategically resembles real war which may explain
why it is by far the most popular sport in the american military in fact the united states military academy
the united states naval academy and the united states air force academy each field football teams that participate in division i a of the ncaa army and navy have a
particularly historic rivalry a physical game american football is a collision sport to stop the offense from advancing the ball the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking him down as such defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball carrier to the ground within certain rules and guidelines tacklers cannot kick punch or trip the runner they also cannot grab the face mask
of the runner s helmet lead into a tackle with their own helmet or lift the ball carrier up off his feet and drop him despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness most other forms of tackling are legal blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the
way quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback s field of vision the high level of physical contact in football makes it more dangerous than other major american team sports to compensate for this players must wear a good deal of special protective equipment such as a padded plastic helmet shoulder pads hip pads and knee pads these protective paddings were introduced decades ago and improved ever since to
help minimize lasting injury to players despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety injuries remain very common in football due to its physical nature twenty five football players mostly high schoolers died from injuries directly related to football from two zero zero zero two zero zero four according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research concussions are common with an estimated six two zero zero zero suffered every year among high school players according to the brain
injury association of arizona it is common to see injuries in the game and deaths are not unheard of the game is particularly risky when played by amateurs without proper gear such as is common amongst americans in backyards and parks across the country some have criticized
american football as a violent sport american football is indeed quite physical in comparison to sports like basketball and soccer
as well as other major american team sports tackle football is often banned
in american schoolyards in favor of touch football which uses two hand touching instead of tackling or flag football in which a player is tackled when an opponent pulls a flag off a belt
attached to the player s waist school physical education classes
often use the two hand touch version of the game leaving the tackles to the school s official after school sports program which can provide the appropriate gear and supervision the level of physical aggression and risk of injury has also made football less appealing to females as they generally lack the muscle and body mass to compete without serious risk the tackle nature of football also tends to favor the largest
and strongest players along with the fastest the average weight of players in the nfl has increased in recent
years all these factors have brought the sport into controversy in the past few decades joining the group of other violent and thus controversial sports such as dodgeball wrestling hockey and boxing critics argue that these sports emphasize size physical strength and brute force and breed aggression and unhealthy competitive attitudes in children others argue that such sports teach sportsmanship and teamwork and though contact sports are all violent to some
degree they always emphasize skill and strategy over mere belligerence development of the game both american football and soccer have their origins in varieties of football played in the united kingdom in the mid one nine th century and american football is directly descended from rugby football rugby was first introduced to north america in canada
brought by the british army garrison in montreal which played a series of games with mcgill university both canadian and american football evolved from this point for an in depth overview of the differences and similarities of canadian football and american football see comparison of canadian and american football american colleges spearheaded the growth of football the first inter collegiate
football game was played between rutgers and princeton universities on november six one eight six nine the game was won by rutgers six four although the game which bore little resemblance to its modern day counterpart was played with two teams of two five men each under rugby like rules but like modern football it was replete with surprise strategy prodigies of determination
and physical prowess to use the words of one of the rutgers players rutgers football american football in its current form grew out of a series
of three games between harvard university and mcgill university of montreal in one eight seven four mcgill played rugby football while harvard played the boston game which was closer to soccer as often happened in those days of far from universal rules the teams alternated rules so that both would have
a fair chance the harvard players liked having the opportunity to run with the ball and in one eight seven five persuaded yale university to adopt rugby rules for their annual game in one eight seven six yale harvard princeton and columbia formed the intercollegiate football association which used the rugby code except for a slight difference in scoring in one eight eight zero walter camp introduced the scrimmage in place of the rugby scrum in one eight eight two the system of downs was introduced to thwart princeton s and yale
s strategy of controlling the ball without trying to score in one eight eight three the number of players was reduced at camp s urging to eleven and camp introduced the soon standard arrangement of a seven man
offensive line with a quarterback two halfbacks and a fullback on september three
one eight nine five the first professional football game was played in latrobe pennsylvania between the latrobe ymca and the jeannette athletic club latrobe won the contest one two zero by the one eight nine zero s interlocking offensive formations such as the flying wedge and the practice of teammates physically dragging ball carrying players forward had made the game extremely dangerous despite restrictions on the flying wedge and other precautions in one nine zero five eighteen players were killed in games president theodore roosevelt informed the universities that
the game must be made safer to force them to respond to his concerns he threatened to pressure congress to make playing football a federal crime in one nine zero six two rival organizing bodies the intercollegiate rules committee and the intercollegiate athletic association met in new york eventually they agreed
on several new rules intended to make the game safer among them the addition of a neutral zone between the scrimmage lines and a requirement that at least six players from each team line up on them the most far reaching innovation they considered though was the legalization of the forward pass this was very controversial at
the time much derided by purists as an alternative means of opening out the play walter camp would have preferred widening the field but representatives from harvard pointed to recently constructed harvard stadium which could not be widened and the forward pass was adopted it has come to shape the whole history of american football as opposed to its cousins around the world in one nine one zero after further deaths interlocking formations were finally outlawed and in one nine one two the field was changed to its current size the value of a
touchdown increased to six points and a fourth down added to each possession the game had achieved its modern form problems in football injuries are more common in american football than in many other sports although rule changes made in the past nine zero years for instance the elimination of
horse collar tackles have gradually lowered the rates of injuries in addition protective equipment has become better for example the optional leather helmets introduced during the one eight nine zero s have been replaced in several stages by required high tech padded plastic helmets with bars protecting the face more recently the use of steroids and the extent thereof has become an object of debate in professional college and even high school football leagues another problem with football is that it is an expensive sport the specialized helmets uniforms and
pads can cost hundreds of dollars there is a widespread perception that football teams based in schools and public recreational leagues consume far more than their fair share of the sports budget although sales of tickets to college and to some extent high school football games often make it a revenue producing sport cleveland browns stadium in cleveland ohio home of the cleveland browns professional college and other leagues football is played at a number of levels in the united states these include the following national football league nfl the top level men s professional league

three also known as the american war of independence was the military component of the american revolution it was fought primarily
between great britain and revolutionaries within thirteen british colonies in north america who proclaimed themselves as the united states of america early in the war the war began largely as a colonial revolt against the economic policies of the british empire and eventually widened far beyond british north america with france spain and the netherlands entering the war against
great britain additionally many native americans fought on both sides of the conflict throughout the war the british were able to use their naval superiority to capture and occupy coastal cities but control of the countryside where most of the population lived largely eluded them french involvement proved decisive with a naval victory in the chesapeake leading to the surrender of a british army at the battle of yorktown in one seven eight
one the treaty of paris in one seven eight three recognized the independence of the united states of america the terms american revolutionary war and american revolution are often used interchangeably though
the american revolution included political and social developments before and after the war itself this article refers solely to the military campaign for a broader perspective including the origins and aftermath of the war see the article on the american revolution combatants choosing sides colonists were divided over which side to support in the war in some areas the struggle was a civil war the
revolutionaries also known as americans or patriots had the support of about four zero to four five percent of the colonial population about one five to
two zero percent of the population supported the british crown during
the war and were known as loyalists or tories loyalists fielded perhaps five zero zero zero zero men during the war years in support of the british empire after the war some seven zero zero zero zero loyalists departed most going to canada great britain or to british colonies in the caribbean when the war began the americans did not have a professional army also known as a standing army each colony had traditionally provided for its own
defenses through the use of local militia militiamen served for only a few weeks or months at a time were generally reluctant to go very far from home and would often come and go as they saw fit militia typically lacked the training and discipline of regular troops but could be effective when
an emergency energized them seeking to coordinate military efforts the continental congress established on paper a regular army the continental army in june one seven seven five and appointed george washington as commander in chief the development of the continental army was always a work in progress and washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war although as many as two five zero zero zero zero men may have served as regulars or as militiamen for the revolutionary cause in the eight years of
the war there were never more than nine zero zero zero zero total men under arms for the americans in any given year armies in north america were small by european standards of the era the greatest number of men that washington personally commanded in the field at any one time
was fewer than one seven zero zero zero european nations german troops serving with the british in north america c ziegler after conrad gessner one seven nine nine early in one seven seven five the british army consisted of about three six zero zero zero men worldwide but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number additionally over the course of the war the british hired about three zero zero zero zero german mercenaries popularly known in the colonies as hessians because many of them came from hesse kassel
germans would make up about one third of the british troop strength in north america
by one seven seven nine the number of british and german troops stationed in north america was over six zero zero zero zero though these were spread from canada to florida france the netherlands and spain entered the war against great britain in an attempt to dilute britain s emerging superpower status early on all
three countries quietly provided financial assistance to the american rebels france officially entered the war in one seven seven eight and soon sent troops ships and military equipment to fight against the british for the remainder of the war spain entered the war in one seven seven nine officially as an ally of france but not the united states spain was not keen on encouraging similar rebellions in her own empire the netherlands entered the war late in one seven eight zero but was soon overwhelmed by the british blacks and
native americans african americans slaves and free blacks served on both sides during the war black soldiers served in northern militias from the outset but this was forbidden in the south where slaveowners feared arming slaves lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia issued an emancipation proclamation in november one seven seven five promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the british sir henry clinton issued a similar edict in new york
in one seven seven nine tens of thousands of slaves escaped to the british lines although possibly as few as one zero zero zero served under arms many of the rest served as orderlies mechanics laborers servants scouts and guides although more than half died in smallpox epidemics that swept the british
forces and a number were driven out of the british lines when food ran low despite dunmore s promises the majority were not given their freedom in response and because of manpower shortages washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the continental army in january one seven seven six all black units were formed in rhode island and massachusetts many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their
masters another all black unit came from haiti with french forces at least five zero zero zero black soldiers fought for the patriot cause most american indian communities east of the mississippi river were affected by the war many divided over the question
of which side to support most native americans who joined the fight fought against the united states since native lands were threatened by expanding american settlement an estimated one three zero zero zero warriors fought on the british side the largest group the iroquois confederacy fielded about one five zero zero warriors against the americans war in the north massachusetts one seven seven four to one seven seven six map of campaigns in the revolutionary war in one
seven seven four the british parliament effectively abolished the provincial government of massachusetts lieutenant general thomas gage already the commander in chief of british troops in north america was also appointed governor of massachusetts and was instructed by king george s government to enforce royal
authority in the troublesome colony however popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in boston gage commanded four regiments of british regulars about four zero zero zero men from his headquarters in boston but the countryside was in the hands of the revolutionaries on the night of april one eight one seven seven five general gage sent nine zero
zero men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at concord massachusetts several riders including paul revere alerted the countryside and when the british troops entered lexington on the morning of april one nine they found seven five minutemen formed up on the village common shots were exchanged and the british moved on to concord where there was more fighting by the time the redcoats as the british soldiers were called began the return march several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road a running fight ensued and the british detachment suffered heavily
with the battle of lexington and concord the shot heard round the world the war had begun afterwards thousands of militiamen converged on boston bottling up the british in the city late in may gage received by sea about four five zero zero reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war william howe john burgoyne and henry clinton they formulated a plan to break out of the city on june one seven one seven seven five british forces under general howe seized the charleston peninsula at the
battle of bunker hill the battle was technically a british victory but losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up thus the siege was not broken and general gage was soon replaced by general howe as the british commander in chief in july one seven seven five newly appointed general washington arrived outside boston to take charge
of the colonial forces the standoff continued throughout the fall and winter in early march one seven seven six heavy cannons that had been captured by the revolutionaries at fort ticonderoga were moved to boston a difficult feat engineered by henry knox when the guns were placed on dorchester heights overlooking the british positions howe s situation became untenable the british evacuated the city on march one seven one seven seven six and sailed for temporary refuge in halifax nova scotia the local militia dispersed and in april washington took
most of the continental army to fortify new york city canada one seven seven five to one seven seven six during the long standoff at boston the continental congress sought a way to seize the initiative elsewhere congress had initially invited french canadians to join them as the fourteenth colony but when
that failed to happen an invasion of canada was authorized in an attempt to drive the british from the primarily francophone colony of quebec comprising present day quebec and ontario two expeditions were undertaken on september one six one seven seven five brigadier general richard montgomery marched north from fort ticonderoga with about one seven zero zero militiamen capturing montreal on november one three general guy carleton the governor of
canada escaped to quebec city the second expedition led by colonel benedict arnold set out from fort western present day maine on september two five the expedition was a logistical nightmare and many men succumbed to smallpox by the time arnold reached quebec city in early november he had but six zero zero of his original one one zero zero men nevertheless arnold demanded the surrender of the city to no avail montgomery joined arnold
and they attacked quebec city on december three one but were soundly defeated by carleton montgomery was killed arnold was wounded and many men were taken prisoner the americans held on outside quebec city until the spring of one seven seven six and then withdrew another attempt was made by
the revolutionaries to push back towards quebec but failed at trois rivi res on june eight one seven seven six carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated arnold in the battle of valcour island in october arnold fell back to fort ticonderoga where the invasion of canada had begun the invasion of canada ended as an embarrassing disaster for the revolutionaries but arnold s improvised navy on lake champlain delayed the fateful british counter thrust the
saratoga campaign until one seven seven seven new york and new jersey one seven seven six to one seven seven seven having withdrawn from boston the british now focused on capturing new york city general howe with the services of his brother admiral lord howe began amassing troops on staten island in july one seven seven six general washington with a smaller army of about two zero zero zero zero men unwittingly violated a cardinal rule
of warfare and divided his troops about equally between long island and manhattan thus allowing the
howes to engage only one half of the continental army at a time in late august the howes transported about two two zero zero zero men including nine zero zero zero hessians to long island in the battle of long island on august two seven one seven seven six the british expertly executed a surprise flanking maneuver driving the revolutionaries back to the brooklyn heights fortifications
general howe then laid siege to the works but washington skillfully managed a nighttime evacuation to manhattan having taken long island the howes moved to seize manhattan on september one five general howe landed about one two zero zero zero men on lower manhattan quickly taking control of new york city the revolutionaries withdrew to harlem heights where they skirmished the next day but held their ground when howe moved to encircle washington s army in october the revolutionaries again fell back and a battle at white plains was fought on october two eight
one seven seven six once more washington retreated but howe instead of aggressively pursuing the withdrawal returned to manhattan and captured fort washington in mid november taking almost three zero zero zero prisoners four days later
fort lee across the hudson river from fort washington was also taken emanuel leutze s one eight five one painting washington crossing the delaware is an iconic image of american history general lord cornwallis continued to chase washington s army through new jersey until the revolutionaries withdrew across the delaware river into pennsylvania in early december with the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season the british entered winter quarters although howe had missed several opportunities to
crush the diminishing rebel army he had killed or captured over five zero zero zero americans he controlled much of new york and new jersey and was in a good position to resume operations in the spring with the rebel capital of philadelphia in striking distance the outlook of the continental army and thus the revolution itself was bleak these are the times that try men s souls wrote thomas paine
who was with the army on the retreat the army had dwindled to fewer than five zero zero zero men fit for duty and would be reduced to one four zero zero after enlistments expired at the end of the year spirits were low popular support was wavering and congress had abandoned philadelphia in despair washington reacted by taking the offensive stealthily crossing the delaware on christmas night and capturing nearly
one zero zero zero hessians at the battle of trenton on december two six one seven seven six cornwallis marched to retake trenton but was outmaneuvered by
washington who successfully attacked the british rearguard at princeton on january three one seven seven seven washington then entered winter quarters at morristown new jersey having retaken much of new jersey and having secured two bold morale boosting victories in quick succession to reinvigorate the flagging revolution saratoga campaign one seven seven seven in the summer of one seven seven seven the british launched a new expedition from canada led by general burgoyne the intention was to
seize the lake champlain and hudson river corridor effectively isolating new england from the rest of the american colonies burgoyne s invasion had two components he would lead about one zero zero zero zero men along lake champlain towards albany new york while a second column of about two zero zero zero men led by
barry st leger would move down the mohawk river valley and link up with burgoyne in albany burgoyne set off in early july recapturing fort ticonderoga from the retreating revolutionaries without firing a shot he then proceeded overland towards albany but revolutionaries slowed his progress through the wilderness by destroying bridges and felling trees in his path running short on supplies in august burgoyne sent a detachment to raid nearby bennington vermont the raiders were decisively defeated by local militia depriving burgoyne
of nearly one zero zero zero men and the much needed supplies the mohawk leader joseph brant commanded both american indians and white loyalists during the american revolutionary war meanwhile st leger half of his force american indians led by joseph brant had laid siege to fort stanwix on the mohawk river about eight zero zero revolutionary militiamen and their indian allies marched to relieve the siege but were
ambushed and scattered by british and indians on august six
at the battle of oriskany iroquois warriors fought on both sides of the battle marking the beginning of a civil war within the six nations when a second relief expedition approached this time led by benedict arnold the siege was lifted and st leger s expedition returned to canada burgoyne was on his own burgoyne pushed on towards albany
his forces now reduced to about six zero zero zero men a revolutionary army of about eight zero zero zero men commanded by the newly arrived general horatio gates had entrenched about one zero miles one six km south of saratoga new york burgoyne sent two zero zero zero men to outflank the revolutionary position but was checked by generals benedict arnold and daniel morgan in the first
battle of saratoga on september one nine one seven seven seven after the battle the two armies dug in burgoyne was in trouble now but he hoped that help from the south might be on the way all along burgoyne
had suggested that his invasion from canada might be supported by a british offensive up the hudson river from howe s location in new york city
however british war planners did not coordinate their efforts general howe had instead sailed away from new york on an expedition to capture philadelphia see next section british general henry clinton left in command at new york did indeed sail up
the hudson in october capturing several forts and burning kingston then the rebel capital of new york but his efforts were not enough to affect the events at saratoga revolutionary militiamen many of them outraged by the reported murder of an american woman at the hands of burgoyne s indian allies flocked to gates s army swelling his force to one one zero zero zero by the beginning of october burgoyne his position becoming desperate launched a new offensive
the second battle of saratoga on october seven the attack was repelled and general arnold though relieved of command by gates rushed to the battle and led a decisive counterattack
badly beaten burgoyne surrendered on october one seven saratoga is often regarded as the turning point of the war revolutionary confidence and determination suffering from howe s successful occupation of philadelphia was renewed even more importantly the victory encouraged france to enter the war against great britain spain and the netherlands soon did the same for the british the war had now become much more complicated philadelphia campaign one seven seven seven to one seven seven eight having secured new york city in his one seven seven six campaign in one seven seven seven general howe concentrated on capturing philadelphia
the seat of the revolutionary government he moved slowly landing one five zero zero zero
troops in late august at the northern end of chesapeake bay about five five miles nine zero km southwest of philadelphia washington positioned his one one zero zero zero men between howe and philadelphia but was outflanked and driven back at the battle of brandywine on september one one one seven seven seven the continental congress once again abandoned the city british and
revolutionary forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days clashing in minor encounters such as the so called paoli massacre on september two six
howe finally outmaneuvered washington and marched into philadelphia unopposed after taking the city the british garrisoned about nine zero zero zero troops in germantown five miles eight km above philadelphia washington unsuccessfully attacked germantown in early
october and then retreated to watch and wait meanwhile the british secured the delaware river by taking with difficulty forts mifflin and mercer in november general washington
s problems at this time were not just with the british in the so called conway cabal some politicians and officers unhappy with washington s recent performance as commander in chief secretively discussed his removal washington offended by the behind the scenes maneuvering laid the whole matter openly before congress his supporters rallied behind him and
the episode abated washington and his army encamped at valley forge in december one seven seven seven about two zero miles three two km from philadelphia where they would stay for the next six months over the winter two five zero zero men out
of one zero zero zero zero died from disease and exposure however the army eventually emerged from valley forge in good order
thanks in part to a training program supervised by baron von steuben meanwhile there was a shakeup in the british command with general clinton replacing howe as commander in chief french entry into the war had changed british war strategy and clinton was ordered by the government to abandon philadelphia and defend new york city
now vulnerable to french naval power washington s army shadowed clinton on his withdrawal and forced a battle at monmouth on june two eight one seven seven eight the last major battle in the north washington s second in command general charles lee ordered a controversial retreat during the battle allowing clinton s army to escape by july clinton was in new york city and washington
was again at white plains both armies were back where they had been two years earlier with the exception of scattered minor actions in the north like the battle of stony point the focus of the war now shifted elsewhere war in the west main article frontier warfare during the american revolution george rogers clark s one eight zero mile two nine zero km trek in the dead of winter led to the capture of general henry hamilton lieutenant governor of canada west of the appalachian
mountains the american revolutionary war was an indian war the british and the continental congress both courted american indians as allies or urged them to remain neutral and many native american communities became divided
over what path to take like the iroquois confederacy tribes such as the cherokees and the shawnees split into factions delawares under white eyes signed the first american indian treaty with the united states but other delawares joined the british the british supplied their indian allies from forts along the great lakes and tribesmen staged raids on revolutionary settlements
in new york kentucky pennsylvania and elsewhere joint iroquois loyalist attacks in the wyoming valley and at cherry valley in one seven seven eight helped provoke the scorched earth sullivan expedition into western new york during
the summer of one seven seven nine on the western front every man woman and child regardless of race was a potential casualty in the ohio country the virginia frontiersman george rogers clark attempted to neutralize british influence among the ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of kaskaskia and vincennes in the summer of one seven seven eight when general henry hamilton the british commander at detroit retook vincennes clark
returned in a surprise march in february one seven seven nine and captured hamilton himself however a decisive victory in the west eluded the united states even as their fortunes had risen in the east the low point on
the frontier came in one seven eight two with the gnadenhutten massacre when pennsylvania militiamen unable to track down enemy warriors executed nearly one zero zero christian delaware noncombatants mostly women and children later that year in the last major encounter of the war a party of kentuckians was soundly defeated by a superior force of british regulars and native americans war in the south during the
first three years of the american revolutionary war the primary military encounters were in the north one notable exception was in june one
seven seven six when general henry clinton sailed south to attack charleston south carolina this ended in humiliating defeat for the british and the patriots remained in control of the southern states for the next three years starting in one seven seven eight the british once again turned their attention to georgia south
carolina north carolina and virginia where they hoped to regain control by recruiting thousands of loyalists on december two nine one seven seven eight an expeditionary corps of three five zero zero men from clinton s army in new york captured savannah georgia an attempt by french and revolutionary forces to retake savannah failed on october nine one seven seven nine in this assault count casimir pulaski the polish commander of american revolutionary cavalry was mortally wounded with savannah secured clinton could now launch a new
assault on charleston south carolina where he had failed in one seven seven six carolinas one seven eight zero to one seven eight one the young and dashing banastre tarleton was
perhaps the best cavalry commander in the war and the most hated man in the south this portrait
was painted by sir joshua reynolds in one seven eight two clinton finally moved against charleston in one seven eight zero blockading the harbor in march and building up about one zero zero zero zero troops in the area inside the city general benjamin lincoln commanded about two six five zero continentals and two five zero zero
militiamen when british colonel banastre tarleton cut off the city s supply
lines in victories at monck s corner in april and lenud s ferry in early may charleston was surrounded on may one two one seven eight zero general lincoln surrendered his five zero zero zero men the largest surrender of u s
troops until the american civil war with relatively few casualties clinton had seized the south s biggest city and seaport winning perhaps the greatest british victory of the war and paving the way for what seemed like certain conquest of the south the remnants of the southern continental army began to withdraw to north carolina but were pursued by colonel tarleton who defeated them at the battle of waxhaws on may two nine one seven eight zero among the americans
a story spread that tarleton had massacred many americans after they had surrendered the truth of this charge is still debated bloody tarleton became a hated name and tarleton s quarter referring to his reputed lack of mercy or quarter soon became a rallying cry
with these events organized american military activity in the south had collapsed the states however carried on their functions and the war was carried on by partisans such as francis marion general clinton turned over british operations in the south to lord cornwallis the continental congress dispatched general horatio gates to the rescue with a new army but gates promptly suffered one of the
worst defeats in u s military history at the battle of camden on august one six one seven eight zero setting the stage for cornwallis to invade north carolina the tables were quickly turned on cornwallis however one wing of his army was utterly defeated at the battle of
kings mountain on october seven one seven eight zero delaying his move into north carolina kings mountain was
noteworthy because it was not a battle between british redcoats and colonial troops it was a battle between american loyalists and american patriots the british plan to raise large loyalist armies failed not enough loyalists enlisted and those who did were at risk once the british army moved on only in georgia did the crown manage to create a counter revolutionary civil government gates was replaced by george washington s most dependable subordinate general nathanael greene greene assigned about one zero zero zero men
to general daniel morgan a superb tactician who crushed tarleton s troops at the
battle of cowpens on january one seven one seven eight one greene proceeded to wear down his opponents in a series of battles guilford court house hobkirk s hill ninety six and eutaw springs each of them tactically a victory for the british but giving no strategic advantage to the victors greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous we fight get beat rise and fight again unable to capture or destroy greene s army cornwallis
moved north to to virginia virginia one seven seven five to one seven eight one virginia had been under revolutionary control since loyalist forces including runaway slaves under governor dunmore had been defeated at the battle of great bridge on december nine one seven seven five after the defeat dunmore and his troops took refuge on british ships off
of norfolk which dunmore bombarded and burned on january one one seven seven six he was driven from an island in chesapeake bay that summer never to return british forces raided virginia sporadically during the war in january one seven eight one the rebel capital of richmond was put to the torch by none other than benedict arnold now a turncoat who had sold his services to the other side and was now a british general in march one
seven eight one general washington dispatched lafayette to defend virginia the young frenchman had three two zero zero men at his command but british troops in the state now reinforced and commanded by cornwallis totaled
seven two zero zero lafayette skirmished with cornwallis avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements the boy cannot escape me cornwallis is supposed to have said however cornwallis was unable to trap lafayette and so he moved his forces to yorktown virginia in july in order to link
up with the british navy war at sea main article naval operations in the american revolutionary war meanwhile the co operation of the french became active in july count rochambeau arrived at newport rhode island that place had been occupied by the british from one seven seven six to the close of

quantities of war supplies to the american rebels from as early as one seven seven seven caribbean the battle of the saintes took place in one seven eight two during the american war of independence and was a victory of a
british fleet under admiral sir george rodney over a french fleet under the comte de grasse the defeat dashed the hopes of france and spain to take jamaica and other colonies from the british india the franco british war spilled over into india in one seven eight zero in the form of the second anglo mysore war the two chief combatants were tipu sultan ruler of the kingdom of mysore and a key french
ally and the british government of madras the anglo mysore conflict was bloody but inconclusive and ended in a draw at the treaty of mangalore in one seven eight four netherlands also in one seven eight zero the british struck against the
united provinces of the netherlands in the fourth anglo dutch war to preempt dutch involvement in the league of armed neutrality directed primarily against the british navy during the war agitation by dutch radicals and a friendly attitude towards the united states by the dutch government both influenced by the american revolution also encouraged the british to attack the war lasted into one seven eight four and was disastrous to the dutch mercantile economy mediterranean on february five one seven eight two spanish and french forces captured minorca which had been under british control since the treaty of utrecht in
one seven one three a further franco spanish effort to recover gibraltar was unsuccessful minorca was ceded to spain in the peace treaty whitehaven an interesting footnote to this war was the actual landing on britain itself of a
ship from the u s navy this occurred in one seven seven eight when the port of whitehaven in cumberland was raided by john paul jones the landing was a surprise attack taken as an action of revenge by jones and was never intended as an invasion nevertheless it caused hysteria in england with the attack showing a weakness that could be exploited by other states such as france or spain its result was an intense period of fortification
in british ports war s end the northern southern and naval theaters of the war converged at yorktown in one seven eight one on september five one seven eight one french naval forces defeated
the british royal navy at the battle of the chesapeake cutting off cornwallis s supplies and transport washington hurriedly moved his troops from new york and a combined franco american force of one seven zero zero zero troops commenced the battle of yorktown on october six one seven eight one cornwallis s position quickly became untenable and on october one nine his army surrendered

minister lord north resigned soon after hearing the news from yorktown in
april one seven eight two the british house of commons voted to end the war in america on november three zero one seven eight two preliminary peace articles were signed in paris the formal
end of the war did not occur until the treaty of paris was signed on september three one seven eight three and the united states congress ratified the treaty on january one four one seven eight four the last british troops left new york city on november two five one seven eight three the reasons for great britain s misfortunes and defeat may be summarized as follows misconception by the home government of the temper and reserve strength of her colonists disbelief at the outset in the probability of a protracted struggle covering the immense
territory in america consequent failure of the british to use their more efficient military strength effectively the safe and fabian generalship of washington and perhaps most significantly the french alliance and european combinations by which at the close of the conflict left great britain without a friend or ally on the continent decisive victory eluded the united states on the western frontier great britain negotiated the paris peace treaty without consulting her indian allies however and ceded much american indian
territory to the united states full of resentment native americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the united states in a series of treaties but the result was essentially an armed truce the fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier the largest being the northwest indian war casualties the total loss of life resulting from the american revolutionary war is unknown as was typical in the wars of the era disease claimed more lives than battle the war took place in the context of a massive smallpox epidemic in north america that probably killed more than one
three zero zero zero zero people historian joseph j ellis suggests that washington s decision to have his troops inoculated may have been the commander in chief s most
important strategic decision casualty figures for the american revolutionaries have varied over the years a recent scholarly estimate
lists six eight two four killed and eight four four five wounded in action the number of revolutionary troop deaths from disease and other non combat causes is estimated at about one eight five zero zero approximately one two zero zero germans were killed in action and six three five four died from illness or accident about one six zero zero zero of the remaining german troops returned home but roughly five

unit of electric current equal to one coulomb per second it is named after andr marie amp re one of the main discoverers of electromagnetism definition the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors
of infinite length of negligible circular cross section and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to two newton per metre of length explanation because it is a base unit the
definition of the ampere is not tied to any other electrical unit
the definition for the ampere is equivalent to fixing a value of the permeability of vacuum to zero four h
m prior to one nine four eight the so called international ampere was used defined in terms of the electrolytic deposition rate of silver the older unit is equal to zero nine nine nine eight five a the ampere is most accurately realised using
an ampere balance but is in practice maintained via ohm s law from the units of voltage and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson junction and the quantum hall effect respectively the unit of electric charge the coulomb is defined in terms of the ampere one coulomb is the amount of electric charge formerly quantity of electricity carried in a current of one ampere flowing for one second current electricity then is the rate at which charge
flows through a wire or surface one ampere of current i is equal to a flow of one coulomb of charge q per second of time t mathrm since a coulomb is approximately equal to six two four elementary charges one ampere is equivalent to six two four elementary charges such as
electrons moving through a surface in one second more precisely using the si definitions for the conventional values of the josephson and von klitzing constants the ampere can be defined as exactly six two four one five zero

either a naked bootleg is a risky variation of this play when the quarterback has no blockers pulling

executed properly the rusher will have to turn upfield before the play calls for it giving the linebackers a
better chance of stopping the play for little or no gain cornerback cb a defensive back who lines up near the line of scrimmage across from a wide receiver their primary
job is to disrupt passing routes and to defend against short and medium passes in the passing game and to contain the
rusher on rushing plays counter a running play in which the
running back will take a step in the apparent direction of the play ie the direction the line is
moving only to get the handoff in the other direction weak side linemen will sometimes pull and lead the back downfield sometimes called a counter trap but not necessarily
the play is designed to get the defense to flow away from the action for a few steps as they follow the linemen allowing more room for the running back crackback block an illegal block delivered below the opponent s waist by an offensive player who had left the area of close line play and then returned to it or was not within it

offensive team must advance at least one zero yards or
lose possession first down is the first of the plays fourth is the last down in american and third in canadian football a first down occurs after a change of possession of the ball after advancing the ball one zero yards following a previous first down or after certain penalties down lineman a player stationed in front of his line of scrimmage and who has

prayer halfback a player position on offense also known as a tailback halfback option play a trick play in which the halfback throws a pass halo violation from one nine eight three until the end of the two zero zero two season in the ncaa college football the halo rule was a penalty for interference with the opportunity to catch a kick the so called halo rule stated that no player of the kicking team may be within two yards of a receiving team player positioned to
catch a punt or kickoff before that person has touched the ball the rule was abolished beginning in the two zero zero three season hand off also known as backward pass a player s handing of a live ball to another player the hand off goes either backwards or laterally as opposed to a forward pass sometimes called a switch in touch football note different usage of term from its rugby meaning
hash marks lines between which the ball begins each play the lines are parallel to and a distance in from the side lines and marked
as broken lines h back a player listed in a roster or depth chart as a fullback and playing as a h ybrid of a fullback
and a tight end holder a player who holds the ball upright for a place kick often backup quarterbacks are used for their superior ball handling ability
holding there are two kinds of holding offensive holding illegally blocking a player from the opposing team by grabbing and holding his uniform or body and defensive holding called against defensive players who impede receivers who are more than five yards from the line of scrimmage but who are not actively making an attempt to catch the ball if the defensive player were to impede an offensive player in the act of catching the ball that would be the more severe penalty of pass interference huddle an on field gathering of members of a
team in order to secretly communicate instructions for the upcoming play i i formation a formation that includes a fullback and tailback lined up with the fullback directly in front of the tailback if a third back is in line this is referred to as a full house i if the third back is lined up along side the fullback it is referred to as a power i incomplete pass a forward pass of the ball which no player legally caught inbounds lines the hash marks inside of a player s path relatively close in reference to the
sides of the field to where the ball was snapped from thus a ballcarrier s path in crossing the neutral zone may be said to be inside of an opponent or an inside run in general and a rushing defensive player may be
said to put on an inside move or inside rush of the movement of the ball between players directed toward a player who cuts between a player in the backfield who throws or hands the ball and the place from which it was snapped thus an inside pass or inside handoff an inside reverse sometimes called a
scissors play is a reverse play via an inside handoff intentional grounding an illegal forward pass thrown beyond the line of scrimmage without an intented
reciever and no chance of completion to any offensive player intentional grounding is not called in the case of a spike or if the quarterback was outside the tackle box at the time of the pass interception
the legal catching of a forward pass thrown by an opposing player j jumbo an offensive package which includes two tight ends a full back and a half back similar to heavy jumbo in which either the half back or the fullback is replaced by another tight end often one or
more of the tight ends is actually a linebacker the new england patriots use mike vrabel this way he has six career regular season tds or offensive linemen in these cases the player must report in as an eligible receiver whereas a tight end is assumed to be one k kick as a

modern usage of the term now indicates a central defensive back with responsibility for run and pass support slightly favoring run support strong side simplistically speaking the side of the field
left or right that has the most players but it depends on the formations of the teams when a team uses one tight end the strong side is the side of the field where the tight end lines up if the offensive package uses no tight end or more
than one tight end the strong side is the side of the field with the most offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage stunt a tactic used by defensive linemen in which they switch roles in an attempt to get past the

which given an initial state will terminate in a defined end state informally the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a recipe
although many algorithms are much more complex algorithms often have steps that repeat iterate or require decisions such as logic or comparison the concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or
multiplying two numbers the concept was formalized in one nine three six through alan turing s turing machines and alonzo church s lambda calculus which in turn formed the foundation of computer science most algorithms can be implemented by computer programs history the word algorithm comes from the name of the nine th century mathematician abu abdullah muhammad bin musa al khwarizmi the
word algorism originally referred only to the rules of performing arithmetic using hindu arabic numerals but evolved via european latin translation of al khwarizmi s name into algorithm by the one eight th century the word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks the first case of an algorithm written for a computer was ada byron s notes
on the analytical engine written in one eight four two for
which she is considered by many to be the world s first programmer however since charles babbage never completed his analytical
engine the algorithm was never implemented on it the lack of mathematical rigor in the well defined procedure definition of algorithms posed some difficulties for mathematicians and logicians of the one nine th and early two zero th centuries this problem was largely solved with the description of the turing machine an abstract model of a computer formulated by alan turing and
the demonstration that every method yet found for describing well defined procedures advanced by other mathematicians could be emulated on a turing machine a statement known as the church turing thesis nowadays a formal criterion for an algorithm is that it is a procedure that can be implemented on a completely specified turing machine or one of the equivalent formalisms formalization of algorithms algorithms are essential to the way computers process information because a
computer program is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to perform in what specific order in
order to carry out a specified task such as calculating employees paychecks or printing students report cards thus an
algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations which can be performed by a turing complete system typically when an algorithm is associated with processing information data is read from an input source or device written to an output sink or device and or stored for further use stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm the state is stored in a data structure for any such computational process the algorithm must be rigorously defined specified in
the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise that is any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with case by case the criteria for each case must be clear and computable because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps the order of computation will almost always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly and are described as starting from the top and going down to the bottom an idea that is described more
formally by flow of control so far this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming this is the most common conception and it attempts to describe a task in discrete mechanical means unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation setting the value of a variable it derives from the intuition of memory as a scratchpad there is an example below of such an assignment see functional programming and logic programming for alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm some writers restrict
the definition of algorithm to procedures that eventually finish others include procedures that could run forever without stopping arguing that some entity may be required to carry out such permanent tasks in the latter case success can no longer be defined in terms of halting with a meaningful output instead terms of success that allow for unbounded output
sequences must be defined for example an algorithm that verifies if there are more zeros than ones in an infinite random binary sequence must run forever to be effective if it is implemented correctly however the algorithm s output will be useful for as long as
it examines the sequence the algorithm will give a positive response while the number of examined zeros outnumber the ones and a negative response otherwise success for this algorithm could then be defined as eventually outputting only positive
responses if there are actually more zeros than ones in the sequence and in any other case outputting any mixture of positive and negative responses summarizing the above discussion about what algorithm should consist zero or more inputs one or more outputs finiteness or computability definitiveness or preciseness implementation an algorithm is a set of steps to perform a computation most algorithms will be implemented as computer programs they can be expressed in any notation including english
for documenting and research purposes a more preferred way is to embody or sometimes called codify an algorithm by writing of its pseudocode pseudocode representation avoids ambiguities that are common in english statements the pseudocode can also be translated into particular programming language more straightforwardly algorithms are implemented not only as computer programs but often also by other means such as in a biological neural network for example the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect relocating food in electric
circuits or in a mechanical device example one of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an unsorted list of numbers the solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list but only once at each from this follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in english as let us assume the first item is largest look at each of
the remaining items in the list and make the following adjustment a if it is larger than the largest item we gathered so far make a note of it the latest noted item is the largest in the list when the process is complete and here is a more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode input a non
empty list of numbers l output the largest number in the list l largest l zero for each item in the list l one do if the item largest then largest the item return largest for a more complex example see euclid s algorithm which is one of the oldest algorithms algorithm analysis as it happens most people who implement algorithms want to know how much
of a particular resource such as time or storage is required for a given algorithm methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers for example the algorithm above has a time requirement of o n using the big o
notation with n as the length of the list at all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values the largest number found so far and its current position in the input list therefore it is said to have a space requirement of o one note that the size of the
inputs is not counted as space used by the algorithm different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in
less or more time space or effort than others for example given two different recipes for making potato salad one may have peel the potato before boil the potato while the other presents the steps in the reverse order yet they both call for these steps to be repeated for all potatoes and end when the potato salad is ready to be eaten the analysis and study of algorithms is one discipline of computer science and is
often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or other implementation in this
sense it resembles other mathematical disciplines in that the analysis focuses on the underlying principles of the algorithm and not on any particular implementation the pseudocode is simplest and abstract enough for such analysis classes there are various ways to classify algorithms each with its
own merits classification by implementation one way to classify algorithms is by implementation means recursion or iteration a recursive algorithm is one that invokes makes reference to itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches which is a method common to functional programming iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems some problems are naturally suited for one implementation to other for example towers of hanoi is well understood in recursive implementation every recursive version has an equivalent but possibly more
or less complex iterative version and vice versa serial or parallel algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time those computers
are sometimes called serial computers an algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm as opposed to parallel algorithms which take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time parallel algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and pass them to many processors and put the results back together at one end the resource consumption in parallel algorithms is both processor cycles on each processors
and also the communication overhead between the processors sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently but their communication overhead is expensive recursive algorithms are generally parallelizable some problems have no parallel algorithms and
are called inherently serial problems those problems cannot be solved faster by employing more
processors iterative numerical methods such as newton s method or the three body problem are algorithms which are inherently serial deterministic or random deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm random algorithms as their name suggests explore the search space randomly until an acceptable solution is found various heuristic algorithms see below generally fall into the random category exact or approximate while many algorithms reach an exact solution approximation algorithms seek an approximation which is
close to the true solution approximation may use either a deterministic or a random strategy such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems classification by design paradigm another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm there is a certain number of paradigms each different from the other furthermore each of these categories will include many different types of algorithms some commonly found paradigms
include divide and conquer a divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly
reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem usually recursively until the instances are small enough
to solve easily one such example of divide and conquer is merge sorting sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in conquer phase by merging them a simpler variant of divide and conquer is called decrease and conquer algorithm that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so conquer stage will be more complex than decrease and
conquer algorithms an example of decrease and conquer algorithm is binary search algorithm dynamic programming when a problem shows optimal substructure meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems and overlapping subproblems meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances we can often solve the problem quickly using dynamic programming an approach that avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex
in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices dynamic programming and
memoization go together the main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer where as the overlap of subproblems occur in dynamic programming the difference between the dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls where subproblems are independent there is no chance of repetition and memoization does not help so dynamic programming is not a solution for
all by using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity the greedy method a greedy algorithm is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm but the difference is that solutions to the subproblems do not have to be known at each stage instead a greedy choice can be made of what looks best for the moment difference between dynamic programming and
greedy method is it extends the solution with the best possible decision not all feasible decisions at a algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision not all possible decisions
made in previous stage it is not exhaustive and does not give accurate answer to
many problems but when it works it will be the fastest method
the most popular greedy algorithm is finding the minimal spanning tree as given by kruskal linear programming
when solving a problem using linear programming the program is put into a number of linear inequalities and then an attempt is made to maximize or minimize the inputs many problems such as the maximum flow for directed graphs can be stated in a linear programming way and then be solved by a generic algorithm such as the simplex algorithm a complex variant of linear programming is called integer programming where the solution space is restricted to all integers reduction it is another powerful technique in solving many
problems by transforming one problem into another problem for example one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list is first translating this problem into sorting problem and finding the middle element in sorted list the goal of reduction algorithms is finding the simplest transformation such that complexity of reduction algorithm does not dominate the complexity of reduced algorithm this technique is also called transform and conquer search and enumeration many problems such as playing chess can
be modeled as problems on graphs a graph exploration algorithm specifies
rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems this category also includes the search algorithms and backtracking the probabilistic and heuristic paradigm algorithms belonging to this class fit the definition of an algorithm more loosely probabilistic algorithms are those that make some choices randomly or pseudo randomly for some problems it can in fact be proven that the fastest solutions must involve some randomness genetic algorithms attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological evolutionary
processes with a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of solutions thus they emulate reproduction and survival of the fittest in genetic programming this approach is extended to algorithms by regarding the algorithm itself as a solution to a problem also there are heuristic algorithms whose general purpose is not to find an optimal solution but an approximate solution where the time or resources to find a perfect solution are not practical an example of this would be local search taboo search or simulated annealing algorithms a class of heuristic probabilistic algorithms that vary the
solution of a problem by a random amount the name simulated annealing alludes to the metallurgic term meaning the heating and cooling of metal to achieve freedom from defects the purpose of the random variance is to find close to globally optimal solutions rather than simply locally optimal ones the idea being that the random element will be decreased as the algorithm settles down to a solution classification by field of study every field of science has its own
problems and needs efficient algorithms related problems in one field are often studied together some example classes are search algorithms sort algorithms merge algorithms numerical algorithms graph algorithms string
algorithms computational geometric algorithms combinatorial algorithms machine learning cryptography data compression algorithms and parsing techniques see also list of algorithms for more details some of
these fields overlap with each other and advancing in algorithms for one field causes advancement in many fields and sometimes completely unrelated fields for example dynamic programming is originally invented for optimisation in resource consumption in industries but it is used in solving broad range of problems in many fields classification by complexity some algorithms complete in linear time and
some complete in exponential amount of time and some never complete one problem may have multiple algorithms and some problems may
have no algorithms some problems have no known efficient algorithms there are also mappings from some problems to other problems so computer scientists found it

due to an image on coins minted during his rule that seemingly depicted him with the two ram s horns of the egyptian god ammon he is known as sikandar in hindi in fact in india the term sikandar is used as a synonym for expert or extremely skilled following the unification of the multiple city states of ancient greece under the rule of his father philip ii of macedon a labor alexander had to repeat
twice because the southern greeks rebelled after philip s death alexander conquered
the persian empire including anatolia syria phoenicia gaza egypt bactria and mesopotamia and extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as the punjab alexander integrated foreigners non macedonians
non greeks into his army and administration leading some scholars to credit him with a policy of fusion he encouraged marriage between his army and foreigners and practiced it himself after twelve years of constant military campaigning alexander died possibly of malaria typhoid viral encephalitis or even a drug overdose his conquests ushered in centuries of greek settlement and rule over foreign areas a period known as the hellenistic age alexander himself lived on in the history and myth of both greek and
non greek cultures already during his lifetime and especially after
his death his exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appears as a towering legendary hero in the tradition of achilles early life bust of alexander iii in the british museum alexander was the son of king philip ii of macedon and of epirote princess olympias according to plutarch alexander three one three olympias was impregnated not by philip who was afraid of her and her affinity for sleeping in
the company of snakes but by zeus plutarch alexander two two three relates that both philip and olympias dreamt of their son
s future birth olympias dreamed of a loud burst of thunder and of lightning striking her womb in philip s dream he sealed her womb with the
seal of the lion alarmed by this he consulted the seer aristander of telmessus who determined that his wife was pregnant and that the child would have the character of a lion aristotle was alexander s tutor he gave alexander a thorough training in rhetoric and literature and stimulated his interest in science medicine and philosophy after his visit to the oracle of ammon at siwa according to all five of the extant
historians arrian curtius diodorus justin and plutarch rumors spread that the oracle had revealed alexander s father to be zeus rather than philip according to plutarch alexander two one his father descended from heracles through caranus and his mother descended from aeacus through
neoptolemus and achilles aristotle gave him a copy of the illiad and a knife that he always hid under his pillow at night the ascent of macedon when philip led an attack on byzantium in three four zero bc alexander aged one six was left in command of macedonia in three three nine bc philip took a second wife to the chagrin of alexander s mother olympias which led to a quarrel between alexander and his father and
threw into question alexander s succession to the macedonian throne in three three eight bc philip created the league of corinth alexander also assisted his father at the decisive battle of chaeronea in this year the cavalry wing led
by alexander annihilated the sacred band of thebes an elite corps previously regarded as invincible philip was content to deprive thebes of her dominion over boeotia and leave a macedonian garrison in the citadel in three three six bc philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter cleopatra to king alexander of epirus the assassin was supposedly a former lover of the king the disgruntled young nobleman pausanias who
held a grudge against philip because the king had ignored a complaint he had expressed philip s murder was once thought to have been planned with the knowledge
and involvement of alexander or olympias another possible instigator could have been darius iii the recently crowned king of persia plutarch mentions an irate letter from alexander to darius where alexander blames darius and bagoas his grand vizier for his father s murder stating that it was darius who had been bragging with the greek cities of how he managed to assassinate philip after philip s death the army proclaimed alexander then aged two zero as the new king of macedon greek cities like athens and thebes which
had been forced to pledge allegiance to philip saw in
the new king an opportunity to retake their full independence alexander moved swiftly and thebes which had been most active against him submitted when he appeared at its gates the assembled greeks at the isthmus
of corinth with the sole exception of the spartans elected him to the command against persia which had
previously been bestowed upon his father the next year three three five bc alexander felt free to engage the thracians and the illyrians in order to secure the danube as the northern boundary of the macedonian kingdom while he was triumphantly campaigning north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again alexander reacted immediately and
while the other cities once again hesitated thebes decided this time to resist with the utmost vigor the resistance was useless in
the end the city was conquered with great bloodshed the thebans encountered an ever harsher fate when their city was razed to the ground and its territory divided between the other boeotian cities moreover all of the city s citizens were sold into slavery sparing only the priests the leaders of the pro macedonian party and the descendants of pindar whose house was the only one left untouched the end of thebes cowed athens into submission and it readily accepted alexander s
demand for the exile of all the leaders of the anti macedonian party demosthenes first of all period of conquests map of alexander s empire the fall of the persian empire alexander s army had crossed the hellespont with about
four two zero zero zero soldiers primarily macedonians and greeks but also including some thracians paionians and illyrians after an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis and proceeded down the ionian
coast at halicarnassus alexander successfully waged the first of many sieges eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the
persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea alexander left caria in the hands of ada who was ruler of caria before being deposed by her brother pixodarus from halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities and denying them to his enemy from pamphylia onward the coast held no major ports and so alexander moved inland at termessus alexander humbled but did not storm the pisidian
city at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the tangled gordian knot a feat said to await the future king of asia according to the most vivid story alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and he hacked it apart with his sword another version claims that he did not use the sword but actually figured out
how to undo the knot alexander battling darius at the battle of issus pompei mosaic alexander s army crossed the cilician gates met and defeated the main persian army under the command of darius iii at the battle of issus in three three three bc darius fled this battle in such a panic for his life that he left behind his wife his children his mother and much of his personal treasure sisygambis the queen mother never forgave darius for abandoning her she disowned him and adopted alexander as her son instead proceeding down the mediterranean coast he took
tyre and gaza after famous sieges see siege of tyre alexander passed near but probably did not visit jerusalem in three three two bc three three one bc
alexander was welcomed as a liberator in egypt and was pronounced the son of zeus by egyptian
priests of the god ammon at the oracle of the god at the siwa oasis in the libyan desert he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death leaving egypt alexander marched eastward into assyria now northern iraq and defeated darius and a third persian army at the battle of gaugamela darius was forced to flee the field after his charioteer was killed and alexander chased him as far

babylon alexander went to susa one of the achaemenid capitals and captured its treasury sending the bulk of his army to persepolis the persian capital by the royal road alexander stormed and captured the persian gates in the modern zagros mountains then sprinted for persepolis before its treasury could be looted alexander allowed the league forces to loot persepolis a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes and spread to the rest of the city it was not known if
it was a drunken accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the athenian acropolis during the second persian
war the book of arda wiraz a zoroastrian work composed in the three rd or four th century ad also speaks of archives containing all the avesta and zand written upon prepared cow skins and with gold ink that were destroyed but it must be said that this statement is often treated
by scholars with a certain measure of skepticism because it is generally thought that for many centuries the avesta was transmitted mainly orally by the magians he then set off in pursuit of darius who was kidnapped and then murdered by followers of bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman bessus then declared himself darius successor as artaxerxes v and retreated into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander with the death of darius alexander declared the war of vengeance over and released his greek and other allies from service
in the league campaign although he allowed those that wished to re enlist as mercenaries in his imperial army his three year campaign against first bessus and then the satrap of sogdiana spitamenes took him through media parthia aria drangiana arachosia bactria and scythia in the process
he captured and refounded herat and maracanda moreover he founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern
kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate the furthest in modern tajikistan in the end both were betrayed by their men bessus in three two nine bc and spitamenes the year after hostility toward alexander during this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably
the custom of proskynesis a symbolic kissing of the hand that persians paid to their social superiors but a practice of which the greeks disapproved the greeks regarded the gesture as the preserve of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it this cost him much in the sympathies of many of his countrymen here too
a plot against his life was revealed and his companion philotas was executed for treason for failing to bring the plot to his attention parmenion philotas father
who was at the head of an army at ecbatana was assassinated by command of alexander who feared that parmenion might attempt to avenge his son several other trials for treason followed and many macedonians were executed later on in a drunken quarrel at maracanda he also killed the man who had saved his life at granicus clitus the black later in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life this one by his own pages
was revealed and his official historian callisthenes of olynthus who had fallen out of favor with the king by leading the opposition to his attempt to introduce proskynesis was implicated on what many historians regard as trumped up charges however the evidence is strong that callisthenes the teacher of the pages must have been the one who persuaded them to assassinate the king the invasion of india coin commemorating alexander s campaigns in india struck in babylon around three two three bc obv alexander standing

porus with the death of spitamenes and his marriage to roxana roshanak in bactrian to cement his relations with his new central asian satrapies in three two six bc alexander was finally free to turn his attention to
india king ambhi ruler of taxila surrendered the city to alexander many people had fled to a high fortress called aornos alexander took aornos by storm alexander fought an epic battle against porus a ruler of a region in the punjab in the battle of hydaspes in three two six bc after attaining victory alexander made an alliance with porus and appointed him as satrap of his own kingdom alexander then
named one of the two new cities that he founded bucephala in honor of his noble mount who had brought him to india alexander continued on to
conquer all the headwaters of the indus river east of porus kingdom near
the ganges river was the powerful empire of magadha ruled by the nanda dynasty fearing the prospects of facing another powerful indian army and exhausted by years of campaigning his army mutinied at the hyphasis modern beas refusing to march further east alexander after the meeting with his officer coenus
was convinced that it was better to return alexander was forced to turn south conquering his way down the indus to the indian ocean he
sent much of his army to carmania modern southern iran with his general craterus and commissioned a fleet to
explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest of his forces back to persia by the southern route through the gedrosia present day makran in southern pakistan after india alexander and porus by charles le brun one six seven three discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence alexander executed a number of them as examples on his way to
susa as a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send those over aged and disabled veterans back to macedonia under craterus but his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis refusing to be sent away and bitterly criticizing his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of
persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units alexander executed the ringleaders of the mutiny but forgave the rank and file in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects he held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen
at opis but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year his attempts to merge persian culture with his greek soldiers also included training a regiment of persian boys in the ways of macedonians it is not certain that alexander adopted the persian royal title of shahanshah great
king or king of kings however most historians believe that he did alexander let it be known that he intended to launch a campaign against the
tribes of arabia after they were subjugated it was assumed that alexander would turn westwards and attack carthage and italy after traveling to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure his closest friend and possible lover hephaestion died of an illness alexander was distraught and on his return to babylon he fell ill and
died alexander s marriages and sexuality alexander s greatest emotional attachment is generally considered to have been to his companion cavalry commander chiliarchos and probable lover hephaestion they had most likely been best friends since childhood for hephaestion too received his education at the court of alexander s father hephaestion makes his appearance in history at the point when alexander reaches troy there the two friends made sacrifices at the shrines of the two heroes achilles and patroclus alexander honoring achilles and hephaestion honoring patroclus as aelian
in his varia historia one two seven claims he thus intimated that he was the object of alexander s love as patroclus was of achilles following hephaestion s death alexander mourned him greatly and did not eat for days many have discussed alexander s ambiguous sexuality curtius reports that he scorned feminine sensual pleasures to such an extent that his mother was anxious lest he
be unable to beget offspring to encourage a relationship with a woman king philip and olympias brought in a high priced thessalian courtesan named callixena later in life alexander married several princesses of former persian territories roxana of bactria statira daughter of darius iii and parysatis daughter of ochus he fathered two children heracles born by his concubine barsine the daughter of satrap artabazus
of phrygia in three two seven bc and alexander iv of macedon born by roxana shortly after his death in three two three bc curtius maintains
that alexander also took as a lover bagoas a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood with whom darius was intimate and with whom alexander would later be intimate vi five two three bagoas is the only one who is actually named as the eromenos the beloved of alexander their relationship seems to have been well known
among the troops as plutarch recounts an episode also mentioned by
dicaearchus during some festivities on the way back from india
in which his men clamor for him to openly kiss the young man bagoas sat down close by him which so pleased the macedonians that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss bagoas and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till alexander put his arms round him and kissed him at this point in time the troops present were all survivors of the crossing of the desert bagoas must have endeared himself to them by his courage and fortitude during that
harrowing episode whatever alexander s relationship with bagoas it was no impediment to relations with his queen six months after alexander s death roxana gave birth to his son and heir alexander iv besides bagoas curtius mentions yet another possible lover of alexander euxenippus whose youthful grace filled him with enthusiasm vii nine one nine allegations concerning
alexander s sexuality remain highly controversial and excite passions in some quarters people of various national ethnic and cultural origins regard him as their hero some argue that historical accounts describing alexander s love for hephaestion and bagoas as sexual were written centuries after the fact and thus it can never be established what the historical relationship between alexander and his male companions were others argue that the same can be said about much of our information regarding alexander such debates however are generally considered anachronistic by scholars of the period who point out that the concept
of homosexuality as understood today did not exist in greco roman antiquity sexual attraction between males was seen as a normal and universal part of human nature since it was believed that men were attracted to beauty an attribute of the young regardless of gender if alexander s love life was transgressive it was not for his love of beautiful youths but for his probable involvement with a man his own age in
a time when the standard model of male love was pederastic see pederasty in ancient greece for more information the army of alexander the great before the battle of gaugamela the army of alexander was for the most part that of his father philip it was composed of light and heavy troops and some engineers medical and staff
units about one third of the army was composed of his greek allies from the hellenic league infantry macedonian battle formation courtesy of the department of history united states military academy the main infantry corps was the phalanx composed of six regiments taxies numbering about two zero zero zero phalangites each each soldier had a long pike called a
sarissa which was up to two one feet long and a short sword for protection the soldier wore a phrygian style helmet and a shield arrian mentions large shields the aspis but this is disputed as it is difficult to wield both a large pike and a large shield at the same time many modern historians claim the phalanx used a smaller shield called a pelta the shield used by peltasts it is unclear whether the phalanx used
body armor but heavy body armor is mentioned in arrian one two eight seven and other ancient sources modern historians believe most of the phalangites did not wear heavy body armor at the time of alexander another important unit were the hypaspists shield bearers arranged into three battalions lochoi of one zero zero zero men each one of the battalions was named the agema and served as the king s bodyguards their armament is unknown and it is difficult to get a clear picture from ancient sources sometimes hypaspists are mentioned in the
front line of the battle just between the phalanx and the heavy cavalry moreover they seem to have acted as an extension of the phalanx fighting as heavy infantry while keeping a link between the heavily clad phalangites and the companion cavalry they also accompanied alexander on flanking marches and were capable of fighting on rough terrain like light troops so it seems they could perform dual functions in addition to the units mentioned above the army included some six zero zero zero greek allied and mercenary hoplites also arranged in phalanxes they carried a shorter spear a dora which
was six or seven feet long and a large aspis alexander also had light infantry units composed of peltasts psiloi and others peltasts are considered to be light infantry although they had a helmet and a small shield and were heavier than the psiloi the best peltasts were the agrianians from thrace cavalry the heavy cavalry included the companion cavalry raised from the macedonian
nobility and the thessalian cavalry the companion cavalry hetairoi friends was divided into eight squadrons called
ile two zero zero strong except the royal squadron of three zero zero they were equipped with a one two foot lance the xyston and heavy body armor the horses were partially clad in armor as well the riders did not carry shields as the xyston required both hands to wield the organization of the thessalian cavalry was similar to the companion cavalry but they had
a shorter spear and fought in a looser formation of light cavalry the prodromoi forerunners secured the wings of the army during battle and went on reconnaissance missions several hundred allied horses rounded out the cavalry death contemporary bust of alexander the great on the afternoon of june one zero one one three two three bc alexander died of
a mysterious illness in the palace of nebuchadrezzar ii of babylon he was just one month shy of attaining three three years of age various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include poisoning by the sons of antipater or others sickness that followed a drinking party or a relapse of the malaria he had contracted in three three six bc what is certain is that on may two nine alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend medius of larissa after some heavy drinking immediately or after a bath he
was forced to bed badly ill the troops started rumors more and more anxious and on june nine the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time they were admitted to his presence one at a time while the
king too ill to speak confined himself to move his hand the day after alexander was dead the poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by justin and curtius the original story stated that cassander son of antipater viceroy of greece brought the poison to alexander in babylon in a mule s hoof and that alexander s royal cupbearer iollas brother of cassander administered it many had powerful motivations for seeing alexander gone and were none the worse for it after his death deadly agents that could have killed alexander
in one or more doses include hellebore and strychnine in r lane fox s opinion the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the
start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world such long acting poisons were probably not available though this discounts the possibility of multiple doses however the warrior culture of macedon favored the sword over strychnine and many ancient historians like plutarch and arrian maintained that alexander was not poisoned but died of natural causes instead it is likely that alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever which were rampant in ancient babylon other illnesses could have also been the culprit including acute pancreatitis or the west nile virus recently theories have
been advanced stating that alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease hellebore believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery with deadly results disease related theories often cite the fact that alexander s health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds including one in india that nearly claimed his life and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness
or another finally killed him no story is conclusive alexander s death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries and each generation offers a new take on it what is certain is that alexander died of a high fever on june one zero or one one of three two three bc on his death bed his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom since alexander had only one heir it was a question of vital importance he answered famously the strongest before dying his final words were
i foresee a great funeral contest over me alexander s funeral games where his marshals fought it out over control of his empire lasted for nearly forty years alexander s death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life before long accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half truths from the actual events no contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level
of self serving recording and as a result what truly happened to alexander the great may never be known alexander s body was placed in a gold anthropid sarcophagus which was in turn placed in a second
gold casket and covered with a purple robe alexander s coffin was placed together with his armor in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an ionic peristyle the decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by diodoros according to legend alexander was preserved in a clay
vessel full of honey which acts as a preservative and interred in a glass coffin according to aelian varia historia one two six four ptolemy
stole the body and brought it to alexandria where it was on display until late antiquity it was here that
ptolemy ix one of the last successors of ptolemy i replaced alexander s sarcophagus with a glass one and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage the citizens of alexandria were outraged at this and soon after ptolemy ix was killed its current whereabouts are unknown the so called alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeological museum is now generally thought to be that of abdylonymus whom hephaestion appointed as
the king of sidon by alexander s order the sarcophagus depicts alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the persians legacy and division of the empire coin of alexander bearing an aramaic language inscription after alexander s death his empire was divided among his officers mostly with the pretense of first preserving a united kingdom later his officers were focused on the explicit formation of rival monarchies and
territorial states ultimately the conflict was settled after the battle of ipsus in phrygia in three zero one bc alexander s empire was divided at first into four major portions cassander ruled in macedon lysimachus
in thrace seleucus in mesopotamia and iran and ptolemy in the levant and egypt antigonus ruled for a while in asia minor and syria but was eventually defeated by the other generals at ipsus three zero one bc

conquests also had long term cultural effects with the flourishing of hellenistic civilization throughout the middle east and central asia and the development of greco buddhist art in the indian subcontinent influence on ancient rome a mural in pompeii depicting the marriage of alexander to barsine stateira in three two four bc the couple are apparently dressed as ares and aphrodite alexander and his exploits were admired by many romans who
wanted to associate themselves with his achievements although very little is known about roman macedonian diplomatic relations of that time julius caesar wept in spain at the mere sight of alexander s statue and pompey the great rummaged through the closets of conquered nations for alexander s two six zero year old cloak which the roman general then wore as the costume of greatness however in his zeal to honor alexander octavian augustus accidentally broke the nose off the macedonian s mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the hero s

alexander the great and the mystery of the elephant medallions university of california press two salima ikram nile currents general timeline alexander s character equestrian statue of alexander the great on the waterfront at thessaloniki capital of greek macedonia modern opinion on alexander has run the gamut from the idea that he believed he was on a divinely inspired mission to unite the human race to the view that he was a megalomaniac bent on world domination such views tend to be anachronistic however and the sources allow for
a variety of interpretations much about alexander s personality and aims remains enigmatic alexander is remembered as a legendary hero in europe and much of both southwest asia and central asia where he is known as iskander or iskandar zulkarnain to zoroastrians on the other hand he is remembered as the destroyer of their first great empire and as the leveller of persepolis ancient sources are generally written with an agenda of either glorifying or denigrating the man making it difficult to evaluate his actual character
most refer to a growing instability and megalomania in the years following gaugamela but it has been suggested
that this simply reflects the greek stereotype of an orientalizing king the murder of his friend clitus which alexander deeply and immediately regretted is often cited as a sign of his paranoia as is his execution of philotas and his general parmenion for failure to pass along details of a
plot against him however this may have been more prudence than paranoia modern alexandrists continue to debate these same issues among others in modern times one unresolved topic involves whether alexander was actually attempting to better the world by his conquests or whether his purpose was primarily to rule the world partially in response to the ubiquity of positive
portrayals of alexander an alternate character is sometimes presented which emphasizes some of alexander s negative aspects some proponents of this view cite the destructions of thebes tyre persepolis and gaza as examples of atrocities and argue that alexander preferred to fight rather than negotiate it is further claimed in response to the view that alexander was generally tolerant of the cultures of those whom he conquered that his attempts at cultural fusion were severely practical and that he never actually admired persian art or culture to this way of thinking alexander was first and foremost a
general rather than a statesman alexander s character also suffers from the interpretation of
historians who themselves are subject to the bias and idealisms of their own time good examples are w w tarn who wrote during the late one nine th century and early two zero th century and who saw alexander in an extremely good light and peter green who wrote after world war ii and for whom alexander did little that was not inherently selfish or ambition driven tarn wrote in an age where world conquest and warrior heroes were acceptable even encouraged whereas green wrote with the backdrop of the
holocaust and nuclear weapons as a result alexander s character is skewed depending on which way the historian s own culture is and further muddles the debate of who he truly was stories and legends according to one story the philosopher anaxarchus checked the vainglory of alexander when he aspired to the honors of divinity by pointing to alexander s wound saying see the
blood of a mortal not the ichor of a god in another version alexander himself pointed out the difference in response to a sycophantic soldier a strong oral tradition although not attested in any extant primary source lists alexander
as having epilepsy known to the greeks as the sacred disease and thought to be a mark of divine favor alexander had a legendary horse named bucephalus meaning ox headed supposedly descended from the mares of diomedes alexander himself while still a young boy tamed this horse after experienced horse trainers failed to do so there
is an apocryphal tale appearing in a redaction of the pseudo historical alexander romance which details another end for the last true pharaoh of egypt soon after alexander s divinity was confirmed by the oracle of zeus ammon a rumor was begun that nectanebo ii did not travel to nubia
but instead to the court of philip ii of macedon in the guise of an egyptian magician he coupled with phillip s wife olympias and from his issue came alexander this myth would hold strong appeal for egyptians
who desired continuity in rule and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule another legend tells of alexander s campaign down into the syrian world toward egypt on the way he planned to lay siege to the city of jerusalem as the victorious armies of the greeks approached the city
word was brought to the jews in jerusalem that the armies were on their way the high priest at that time who was a godly old man by the name of jaddua mentioned also in the bible book of nehemiah took the sacred writings of daniel the prophet and accompanied by a host of other priests dressed in white garments went forth and met alexander some distance outside the city all this is from the report of josephus the jewish historian who tells us that alexander left his army and
hurried to meet this body of priests when he met them he told
the high priest that he had had a vision the night before in which god had shown him an old man robed in a white garment who would show him something of great significance to himself according to the account the high priest then opened the prophecies of daniel and read them to alexander in the prophecies alexander was able to see the predictions that he would become that notable goat with the horn in his forehead who would
come from the west and smash the power of persia
and conquer the world he was so overwhelmed by the accuracy of this prophecy and of course by the fact that it spoke about him that he promised that he would save jerusalem from siege and sent the high priest back with honors ancient sources the ancient sources for alexander s life are from the perspective of ancient history relatively numerous alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter fragments of dubious authenticity but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full
accounts the key contemporary historians are considered callisthenes his general ptolemy aristobulus nearchus and onesicritus another influential account was penned by cleitarchus who while not
a direct witness of alexander s expedition used the sources which had just been published his work was to be the backbone of that of timagenes who heavily influenced many surviving historians unfortunately all these works were lost instead the modern historian must rely on authors who used these and other early sources the five main accounts are by arrian curtius
plutarch diodorus and justin anabasis alexandri the campaigns of alexander in greek by the greek historian arrian of
nicomedia writing in the two nd century ad and based largely on ptolemy and to a lesser extent aristobulus and nearchus it is considered generally the most trustworthy source historiae alexandri magni a biography of alexander in ten books of which the last eight survive by the roman historian quintus curtius rufus written in the one st century ad and based largely on cleitarchus through the mediation of
timagenes with some material probably from ptolemy life of alexander see parallel lives and two orations on the fortune or the virtue of alexander the great see moralia by the greek historian and biographer plutarch of chaeronea in the second century based largely on aristobulus and especially cleitarchus bibliotheca historia library of world history written in greek by the sicilian historian diodorus siculus from which book one seven relates the conquests of alexander based almost entirely on timagenes s work the
books immediately before and after on philip and alexander s successors throw light on alexander s reign the epitome of the philippic history of pompeius trogus by justin which contains factual errors and is highly compressed it is difficult in this case to understand the source since we only have an epitome but it is thought that also pompeius trogus may have limited himself to use timagenes for his latin
history to these five main sources some like to add the metz epitome an anonymous late latin work that narrates alexander s campaigns from hyrcania to india much is also recounted incidentally in other authors including strabo athenaeus polyaenus aelian and others the problem of the sources is the main concern and chief delight of alexander historians in effect each presents a different alexander with details to suit arrian is mostly interested in the military aspects while curtius veers
to a more private and darker alexander plutarch can t resist a good story light or dark all with the possible exception of arrian include a considerable level of fantasy prompting strabo to remark all who wrote about alexander preferred the marvellous to the true nevertheless the sources tell us much and leave much to our interpretation and imagination alexander s legend alexander was a legend in his own time his court historian callisthenes portrayed the sea in cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis
writing after alexander s death another participant onesicritus went so far as to invent a tryst between alexander and thalestris queen of the mythical amazons when onesicritus read this passage to his patron alexander s general and later king lysimachus lysimachus reportedly quipped i wonder where i was at the time in the first centuries after alexander s death probably in alexandria a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text
known as the alexander romance later falsely ascribed to the historian callisthenes and therefore known as pseudo callisthenes this text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout antiquity and the middle ages exhibiting a plasticity unseen in higher literary forms latin and syriac translations were made in late antiquity from these versions were developed in all the major languages of europe and the middle east including armenian georgian persian arabic turkish hebrew serbian slavonic romanian hungarian german english italian and french the romance is regarded by most
western scholars as the source of the account of alexander given in the qur an sura the cave it is the source of many incidents in ferdowsi s shahnama a mongolian version is also extant some believe that excepting certain religious texts
it is the most widely read work of pre modern times alexander s legend in non western sources alexander was often identified in persian and arabic language sources as dhul qarnayn arabic for the two horned one possibly a reference to the appearance
of a horn headed figure that appears on coins minted during his rule
and later imitated in ancient middle eastern coinage if this theory is followed islamic accounts of the alexander legend particularly in the qur an and in persian legends combined the pseudo callisthenes legendary pseudo religious material about alexander the same legends from the pseudo callisthenes were combined in persia with sasanid persian ideas about alexander in the iskandarnamah main towns founded by alexander around seventy towns or outposts are claimed to have

for developing the theory of general semantics early life and career he came from an aristocratic family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations and he chose to train as an engineer korzybski was educated at the warsaw university of technology during the
first world war korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army after being wounded in his leg and suffering other injuries he came to north america in one nine one six first to canada then the united states to coordinate the shipment of artillery to the war front he also lectured to polish american audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds following the war he decided to remain in the united states
becoming a naturalized citizen in one nine four zero his first book manhood of humanity was published in one nine two one in the book he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind mankind as a time binding class of life general semantics korzybski s work culminated in the founding of a discipline that he called general semantics gs as korzybski explicitly said gs should not be confused
with semantics a different subject the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are outlined in science and sanity published in one nine three three in one nine three eight korzybski founded the institute of general semantics and directed it until his death in simplified form the essence of korzybski s work was
the claim that human beings are limited in what they know
by one the structure of their nervous systems and two the structure of their languages human beings cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions nonverbal impressions or gleanings derived
from the nervous system and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the facts with which we must deal
our understanding of what is going on sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually going on he stressed training in awareness of abstracting using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting his system included modifying the way we approach the world e g with an attitude of i
don t know let s see to better discover or reflect its realities as shown by modern science one of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience that he called silence on the objective levels korzybski and to be it is often said that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be an unfortunate exaggeration he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were
faulty in structure e g a statement such as joe is a fool said of a person named joe who has
done something that we regard as dumb korzybski s remedy was to deny identity in this example to be continually aware that joe is not what we call him we find joe not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain this was expressed in korzybski s most famous premise the map is not the territory note that the map is not the territory uses the phrase is not a form of the verb to be this example shows that he did not intend to abandon the
verb as such anecdote about korzybski one day korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students and he suddenly interrupted the lesson in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from
his briefcase he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row
if they would also like a biscuit a few students took a biscuit nice biscuit don t you think said korzybski while he took a second one the students were chewing vigorously then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging on it was a big picture of a dog s head and the words dog cookies the students looked at the package and were shocked two of them wanted to throw up put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall
to the toilet you see ladies and gentlemen korzybski remarked i have just demonstrated that people don t just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter apparently his prank aimed to illustrate how human
suffering originates from the confusion or conflation of linguistic representations of reality and reality itself source r diekstra haarlemmer dagblad one nine nine three cited by l derks j hollander essenties van nlp utrecht servire one nine nine six p five eight impact korzybski s work influenced neuro linguistic programming especially the metamodel gestalt therapy rational emotive behavior therapy and individuals such as albert ellis gregory bateson buckminster fuller alvin toffler robert a heinlein l ron hubbard a e van vogt robert anton wilson tommy hall lyricist for the one three th floor elevators and scientists such as william

the player to shoot and destroy asteroids without being hit by the fragments it was one of the most popular and influential games of the golden age of arcade games description asteroids was inspired in a roundabout way by the seminal spacewar the first computer based video game in the early one nine eight zero s a stand up arcade game version was produced as space wars which included a number of optional versions and added a floating asteroid as a visual device asteroids is essentially a one player
version of spacewar featuring the wedge ship from the original and promoting the asteroids to be the main opponent the game was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg asteroids was a hit in the
united states and became one of atari s best selling games of all time atari had been in the process of releasing a vector beam version of lunar lander but demand for asteroids was
so high they simply pulled them apart and converted them over today the lunar lander version is difficult to find asteroids was so popular that video arcade
owners usually had to install larger boxes to hold all the coins this machine raked in one feature of the game was the ability for players to record their initials with their high scores an innovation which
is standard in arcade games to this day asteroids was the first of several games to use atari s quadra scan vector refresh system although a raster based full color version was developed for the atari two six zero zero home video game system later full color quadra scan games would include tempest features the player s controls consisted of thrust and fire buttons and rotate left
rotate right buttons actually rotate counterclockwise and rotate clockwise respectively the momentum of the player
s ship was not conserved and it would start to slow down if thrust was not applied there was also a hyperspace button which randomly teleported the player s ship somewhere on the screen with the risk of exploding upon rematerialization or rematerializing inside an asteroid the player s ship spawned in the middle of the screen with four large asteroids drifting around each large asteroid two zero points would break into two medium sized ones five zero points when shot which in turn would break into two small one zero zero points asteroids the
medium and small asteroids once spawned could travel at widely varying speeds periodically one of two types of flying saucers ufos would fly onto the screen the big one worth two zero zero points would shoot in random directions while the small one one zero zero zero points would attempt to aim at the player they tended to
appear more often when few asteroids remained on the screen and or the player hadn t shot an asteroid recently the screen wrapped around allowing the player s ship as well as asteroids
and shots but not saucers to fly off the one edge of the screen and reappear on the opposite side once a level had been cleared of all asteroids and ufos a new set of large asteroids would appear increasing by two each round up to a maximum of one two the maximum score possible was nine nine nine nine zero points after which it turned back over to zero a player who desired to get onto the top score list then had to be careful to shoot just enough asteroids ufos to reach this score without
going over including committing suicide with the last ship left to reach the final total on some early versions of the game it was possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids lurking the small ufo is the key to high scores for many advanced
players soon after the release of asteroids some players discovered that small ufos would be continually sent out when the asteroid count decreased to
a certain level since these ufos were worth one zero zero zero points each a significant sum on this game a strategy known as lurking soon developed around this players
would shoot asteroids until there was only one small or mid sized rock remaining and then maneuver the ship to a spot approximately one inch from any corner of the screen small ufos would then be ambushed as soon as they emerged and before they were able to return fire using wraparound fire if necessary
because the small ufos were unable to lead the player s ship with their fire i e aiming ahead of the ship s flight path a
clever player could manuever if necessary in such a way as to virtually ensure they would never be hit by the small ufo in fact
the large ufo in a sense was seen as more of a threat precisely because of its unpredictable random shots since each one zero zero zero zero points awarded an extra life players could continue almost indefinitely once the practice had been mastered the designers abolished this practice in asteroids deluxe by causing the ufos to either shoot at the remaining asteroids thus ending the round or shoot at the player as soon as they appeared on the screen they also gained the ability to lead the player s ship as well making them much more dangerous however it was
also possible to succeed by shooting the asteroids instead a shrewd asteroid hunting player would typically attempt to kill all the asteroids inside a large one before shooting another asteroid thus minimizing the amount of clutter on the screen technical description the asteroids arcade machine is a so called vector game this means
that the game graphics are composed entirely of lines which are drawn on a vector monitor the hardware consists primarily of a standard mos six five zero two cpu which executes the game program and the digital vector generator dvg vector processing circuitry developed by atari themselves as the six five zero two by itself was too slow to control both the
game play and the vector hardware at the same time the latter task was delegated to the dvg for each picture frame the six five zero two writes graphics commands for the dvg into a defined area of ram the vector ram and then asks the dvg to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen the dvg reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor there are dvg commands for positioning the cathode ray
for drawing a line to a specified destination calling a subroutine with further commands and so on asteroids also features various sound effects each of which is implemented by its own circuitry the cpu activates these audio circuits and other hardware components by writing to special memory addresses memory mapped ports the inputs from the player s controls buttons are also mapped into the cpu address space the main asteroids game program uses
only four kb of rom code another four kb of vector rom contain the descriptions of the main graphical elements rocks saucer player s ship explosion pictures letters and digits in the form of dvg commands legacy the gameplay in asteroids was imitated by many games that followed for example one of the objects of sinistar is to shoot asteroids in order to get them to release resources which the player needs to collect due to its success asteroids was followed by three sequels asteroids deluxe one nine eight zero space duel one nine eight two blasteroids one nine

just three families alismataceae butomaceae and limnocharitaceae the other families were not considered as alismatids and were assigned to various distinct orders but this approach produced polyphyletic groups and so the whole group of families is now placed into a single order the petrosaviaceae have been placed in this order but their actual affinity is not so clear the alismatids have been considered the sister group of the arales and the latter are now included here as a result of this merger the araceae became the most important family in the order accounting

the family cornaceae apiales the asterales are an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants which include the composite family asteraceae sunflowers and daisies and its related families the order is cosmopolitic and includes mostly herbaceous species although a small number of trees lobelia and shrubs is also present the asterales can be characterized on the morphological and molecular level synapomorphies include the oligosaccharide inulin as the nutrients storage and the stamens are usually aggregated densely around the style or even are fused into a tube around it
the last property is probably associated with the plunger or secondary pollination which is common among the families of the order families the asterales include about eleven families the largest of which is asteraceae with about two five zero zero zero species and campanulaceae with about two zero zero zero species the remaining families count together for less than five zero zero species the two large families are cosmopolitic with center of mass in the northern hemisphere and the smaller ones

orbit groups and families main articles asteroid family and minor planet many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based
on their orbital characteristics it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member
of that group to be discovered groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are much tighter and result from the catastrophic break up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the
past for a full listing of known asteroid groups and families see minor planet and asteroid family
spectral classification two five three mathilde a c type asteroid in one nine seven five an asteroid taxonomic system based on colour albedo and spectral shape was developed by clark r chapman david morrison and ben zellner these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of
the asteroid s surface material originally they classified only three types of asteroids c type asteroids carbonaceous seven five of known asteroids s type asteroids silicaceous one seven of known
asteroids m type asteroids metallic most of the remaining asteroids this list has since been expanded to include a number of other asteroid types the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied see asteroid spectral types for more detail or
for a list note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals problems with spectral classification originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid s composition c carbonaceous s silicaceous m metallic however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and there are a variety of
classifications in use this has led to significant confusion while asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials at present the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the one nine nine zero s is still the standard scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids e g finer resolution spectra or non spectral data such as
densities would be very useful asteroid discovery historical discovery methods asteroid discovery methods have drastically improved over the past two centuries in the last years of the one eight th century baron franz xaver von zach organized a group of two four astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about two eight au from the sun by the titius bode law partly as a consequence of the discovery by sir william herschel in one seven eight
one of the planet uranus at the distance predicted by the law this task required that hand drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed upon limit of faintness on subsequent nights the sky would be charted again and any moving object would hopefully be spotted the expected motion of the missing planet was about three zero seconds of arc per hour readily discernable by observers ironically the first asteroid one ceres was
not discovered by a member of the group but rather by accident in one eight zero one by giuseppe piazzi
director at the time of the observatory of palermo in sicily he discovered a new star like object in taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights his colleague carl friedrich
gauss used these observations to determine the exact distance from this unknown object to the earth gauss calculations placed the object between the planets mars and jupiter piazzi named it after ceres the roman goddess of agriculture three other asteroids two pallas three juno four vesta were discovered over the next few years with vesta found in one eight zero seven after eight more years of fruitless searches most astronomers assumed that there
were no more and abandoned any further searches however karl ludwig hencke persisted and began searching for more asteroids in one eight three zero fifteen years later he found five astraea the first new asteroid in three eight years he also found six hebe less than two years later after this other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that except the wartime year one nine four five notable asteroid hunters of this early era were j r hind annibale de gasparis robert
luther h m s goldschmidt jean chacornac james ferguson norman robert pogson e w tempel j c watson c h f peters a borrelly j palisa paul henry and prosper henry and auguste charlois in one eight nine one however max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long exposure photographic plates this drastically increased the rate of detection compared with previous visual
methods wolf alone discovered two four eight asteroids beginning with three two three brucia whereas only slightly more than three zero zero had been discovered up to that point still a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named it was known that there were many more but most astronomers
did not bother with them calling them vermin of the skies modern discovery methods until one nine nine eight asteroids were discovered by a four step process first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide field telescope pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days second the two films of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope any body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films under the stereoscope the image of
the body would appear to float slightly above the background of stars third once a moving body was identified
its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope the location would
be measured relative to known star locations these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a code of two letters representing the week of discovery and of a number so more than the one discovered one
took place in this week example one nine nine eight fj seven four the final step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations
to brian marsden of the minor planet center dr marsden has computer programs that compute whether an apparition ties together previous apparitions into a single orbit if so the object gets a number the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and he gets the honour of naming the asteroid subject to the approval of the international astronomical union once it is numbered latest technology
detecting hazardous asteroids there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earth s orbit and that could given enough time collide with earth see earth crosser asteroids the three most important groups of near earth asteroids are the
apollos amors and the atens various asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed the near earth asteroid four three three eros had been discovered as long ago as one eight nine eight and the one nine three zero s brought a flurry of similar objects in order of discovery these were one two two one amor
one eight six two apollo two one zero one adonis and finally six nine two three zero hermes which approached within zero zero zero five au of the earth in one nine three seven astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact two events in later decades increased the level of alarm the increasing acceptance of walter alvarez theory of dinosaur extinction being due to an impact event and the one nine nine four observation of comet shoemaker levy nine crashing into jupiter the u s military also declassified the information that its military
satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to one zero metres across all of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of
charge coupled device ccd cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes since one nine nine eight a large majority of the asteroids have
been discovered by such automated systems a list of teams using such automated systems includes the lincoln near earth asteroid research linear team the near earth asteroid tracking neat team spacewatch the lowell observatory near earth object search loneos team the catalina sky survey css the campo imperatore near earth objects survey cineos team the japanese spaceguard association the asiago dlr asteroid survey adas the linear system alone has discovered six two two eight three asteroids as of december one four two zero zero five between all of the automated systems three eight six eight
near earth asteroids have been discovered including over six zero zero more than one km in diameter naming asteroids the naming format newly discovered asteroids are given a provisional designation consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code such as two zero zero one fh when its orbit is confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name e g one ceres the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number e g four three three eros however dropping the parentheses is quite common informally especially when a name
is repeated in running text it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention the minor planet circular mpc of october one nine two zero zero five was a historical one as it saw the highest numbered asteroid jump from nine nine nine four seven
to one one eight one six one causing a small y two k like crisis for various automated data services up until then only five digits were allowed in most data formats for the asteroid number this has been addressed in some data fields by having the leftmost digit the ten thousands place use the alphabet as a digit extension a one zero b one one z three five a three
six z six one the highest number one two zero four three seven thus is cross referenced as c zero four three seven on some lists also the fictional asteroid of the little prince b six one two now could be connected with the real one one zero six one two two zero zero one ta one four two which is listed as b zero six one two two zero zero

asteroid s provisional designation may become used as a name in itself the still unnamed one five seven six zero one nine nine two qb gave its name to a group of asteroids
which became known as cubewanos sources for names the first
few asteroids were named after figures from graeco roman mythology but as such names started to run out others were used famous people literary characters the names of the discoverer s wives children and even television characters the first asteroid to be
given a non mythological name was two zero massalia named after the city of marseilles for some time only female or feminized names were used alexander von humboldt was the first man to have an asteroid named after him but his name was feminized to five four alexandra this unspoken tradition lasted until three three four chicago was named even then oddly feminised names show up in the list for years afterward as the
number of asteroids began to run into the hundreds and eventually the thousands discoverers began to give them increasingly frivolous names the first hints of this were four eight two petrina and four eight three seppina named after the discoverer s pet dogs however there was little controversy about this until one nine seven one upon the naming of two three

bore a resemblance to him although the iau subsequently banned pet names as sources eccentric asteroid names are still being proposed and

to five but ceres through vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the one eight six seven edition a few more asteroids two eight bellona three five leukothea and three seven fides
would be given symbols as well as using the numbering scheme the circle would become a pair of parentheses and the parentheses sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades for details see james l hilton two zero zero one when did the asteroids become minor planets asteroid exploration until the age of space travel asteroids were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes

one may allocute before a legislative body in an effort to influence their position on an issue in law it is generally meant to state specifically and in detail what one did and or why often in relation to commission of a crime in most jurisdictions a defendant is allowed the opportunity to allocute that is explain himself before sentence is passed some jurisdictions hold this as an absolute right and in its absence a sentence may potentially be overturned with the result that a new sentencing
hearing must be held allocution is sometimes required of a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime in a plea bargain in exchange for a reduced sentence in this instance allocution can serve to provide closure for victims or their families in principle it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant s
guilt in the matter however there have been many cases in which the defendant allocuted to a crime that he did not commit often because this is a requirement to receiving a lesser sentence the term allocution is generally only in use in jurisdictions in the united states though there are similar processes in other nations see also confession law an affidavit is

range of audiences because there are a wide range of different genres that any series may be categorised under anime may be broadcast on television distributed on media such as dvds or published as console and computer games anime is often influenced by japanese comics known as manga anime may also be adapted into live action television programs a scene from cowboy bebop one nine nine eight toc history atom star of the long running science fiction series mighty atom also known as astro
boy to western audiences the history of anime begins at the start
of the two zero th century when japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques that were being explored in the west during the one nine seven zero s anime developed further separating itself from its western roots and developing unique genres such as mecha in the one nine eight zero s anime was accepted in the mainstream in japan and experienced a boom in production the one nine nine zero s and two zero zero zero s
saw an increased acceptance of anime in overseas markets terminology the japanese term for animation is anim shon
pronounced written in katakana it is a direct transliteration and reborrowed loanword of the english term animation the japanese term is abbreviated as anime pronounced both the original and abbreviated forms are valid and interchangeable in japanese but as could
be expected the abbreviated form is more commonly used the term is a broad one and does not specify an animation s nation of origin or style pronunciation the english word anime is a transliteration of the abbreviated version of this japanese term and it is typically pronounced as or ann ih may ah nee may is a less common variant some theorize the word comes from the french anim animated or les dessins anim s animated drawings and pronounce it as ah nee may though the japanese
themselves deny this theory and the fact that it is written in japanese syllables as anime rather than animei further lowers its credibility as with a few other japanese words such as pok mon and kobo ab anime is sometimes spelled as anim in english with an acute accent over the final e to cue the reader that the letter is pronounced as hence the pronunciations ah neem and uh neem are generally considered incorrect syntax anime can be used as a common noun do you watch anime or as a suppletive adjective the anime
guyver is different from the movie guyver it may also be used as a mass noun as in how much anime have you collected and therefore is never pluralized animes nouns are never pluralized in japanese synonyms anime is sometimes referred to by the blend word japanimation but this term has fallen into disuse it saw the most usage during the one nine seven zero s and one nine eight zero s which broadly comprise the first and second waves of anime fandom
the term survived at least into the early one nine nine zero s but seemed to fade away shortly before the mid one nine nine zero s anime resurgence in general the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts the term is much more commonly used within japan to refer to domestic animation since anime or anim shon is used to describe all forms of animation japanimation is used to distinguish japanese work from that
of the rest of the world in more recent years anime has also frequently
been referred to as manga in europe a practice that may stem from the japanese usage in japan manga can refer to both animation and comics although the use of manga to refer to animation is mostly restricted to non fans among english speakers manga usually has the stricter meaning of japanese comics an alternate explanation is that it is due to the prominence of manga entertainment a distributor of anime to the us and uk markets because manga entertainment started out in the uk this use of the term is much
more common in europe characteristics dragon ball z is one of the most popular sh nen anime anime features a wide variety of artistic styles which

can be used to describe any anime that features pretty girl characters for example magic knight rayearth bish nen japanese for beautiful boy blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty and elegant boys and men for example fushigi y gi ecchi japanese for indecent sexuality contains mild sexual humor for example love hina hentai japanese for abnormal or perverted and used by western audiences to refer to pornographic anime or erotica however in japan the term used to refer to the same material is
typically poruno or ero josei japanese for young woman this is anime or manga that is aimed at young women and is one of the rarest forms kodomo japanese for child this is anime
or manga that is aimed at young children for example doraemon mecha anime or manga featuring giant robots example mobile suit gundam mo anime or manga featuring characters that are extremely perky or cute for example little snow fairy sugar progressive art films or extremely stylized anime for example voices of a distant star seinen anime or manga similar to sh nen but targeted at teenage or young male adults for example oh my goddess sentai super sentai literally fighting team in japanese refers to any show that involves a superhero team for example cyborg zero
zero nine sh jo japanese for young lady or little girl refers to anime or manga targeted at girls for example fruits basket mah sh jo subgenre of shoujo known for magical girl stories for example sailor moon sh jo ai japanese for girl love refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between female characters for example revolutionary girl utena sh nen japanese for
boys refers to anime or manga targeted at boys for example dragon ball z sh nen ai japanese for boy love refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between male characters this term is being phased out in japan due to references to pedophilia and is being replaced by the term boys love bl an example of this style is gravitation some anime titles are
written for a very specific audience even narrower than those described above for example initial
d and x driver concern street racing and car tuning ashita no joe is about boxing hanaukyo maid team is based on the french maid fantasy recently the national child exploitation coordination centre of canada has incorrectly classified all
anime as hentai giving an improper impression of the content of most anime and manga series this occurred despite having linked to this wikipedia page in order to establish a definition of terms the site can be viewed at the following link complaints about the article s content and improper citations caused the ncecc to revise the citations but not the content music much like western live action cinema anime uses music as an important artistic tool anime soundtracks are big business in japan and are often times met with similar demand as chart topping pop albums it is
for this reason that anime music is often composed and performed by a list musicians stars and composers skilled bgm composers are highly respected in the anime fan community anime series with opening credits use the opening theme song as a quick introduction to the show the most frequent use of music in anime is background music or bgm bgm is used to set the tone of a given scene for
example neon genesis evangelion s decisive battle is played when the characters are making battle preparations and it features heavy drum beats and a militaristic style which highlights the tension of the scene and hints at the action to follow the theme song also referred to as the opening song or abbreviated as op usually matches the overall tone of the show and serves to get the viewer
excited about the upcoming program insert songs and ending songs abbr ed often make commentary about the plot or the program as a whole and are often times used to highlight a particularly important scene opening and ending themes as well as insert songs are frequently performed by popular musicians or japanese idols so in this way songs become a very important component of an anime program in addition to the themes the seiy for a specific anime also frequently releases cd for their character
called image albums despite the word image in the cd s name it only contains music and or voice messages where the seiy talks with the audience or about herself making the listener think that the character him herself is singing another type of anime cds release are drama cd featuring songs and tracks
which makes use of the seiy to tell a story often not included in the main anime animation style lum from urusei yatsura an iconic anime character the drawing style used in anime is counter productive to the animation process having far too many details and subsequently making it difficult to keep the number of drawings comparable to other cartoons with design ethics that stress simplicity this may be due to a philosophy of applying more effort into each of a few drawings than less effort into one of many osamu tezuka adapted and simplified many disney animation
precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production though it should be noted that disney films made in the west are not anime this was intended to
be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff anime studios have since perfected techniques to draw as little new animation as possible using scrolling or repeating backgrounds still shots of characters sliding across the screen and
dialogue which involves only animating mouths while the rest of the screen remains absolutely still a technique not wholly unfamiliar to western animation the overall effect of these techniques such as reduced frame rate several still shots and scrolling backgrounds has led some critics to accuse anime of choppiness or poor quality in general see also limited animation there are often scenes where the frame rate of the animation far
exceeds the quality of the rest of the production these are commonly referred to as money shots outside of japan where more effort
is put into the animation of one scene to give it emphasis over the rest of the
work animator yasuo otsuka was the pioneer of this technique exceptions to these rules are early classic films such as those produced by toei animation up until the mid one nine six zero s and recent big budget films such as those produced by the enormously successful studio ghibli these movies have much higher production values due to their anticipated success at the box office some animators in japan overcome production values by utilizing different techniques than the disney or the old tezuka otsuka methods of animating anime directors such as hiroyuki imaishi cutey honey dead leaves simplify
backgrounds so that more attention can be paid to character animation other animators like tatsuyuki tanaka in koji minamoto s eternal family in particular use squash and stretch an animation technique not often used by japanese animators tanaka makes other
shortcuts to compensate for this some higher budgeted television and ova original video animation series also forego the shortcuts found in most other anime while different titles and different artists have their own unique artistic styles many stylistic elements have become extremely common some examples have become so common that they are often described as being definitive of anime in general and have been given names
of their own the most common is the large eyes style drawn on many anime characters common mainly due to the influence of osamu tezuka who was inspired by the exaggerated features of western cartoon characters such as betty boop and mickey mouse and from disney s bambi tezuka found that large eyes allowed his characters to better express
their emotions some western audiences have interpreted such stylized eyes as
more caucasian cultural anthropologist matt thorn argues that japanese animators and audiences do not perceive them as inherently more or less foreign when tezuka began drawing ribbon no kishi the first manga specifically targeted at young girls tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters eyes indeed through ribbon no kishi tezuka set a stylistic template that later sh jo artists tended to follow another variation of this style is chibi or super deformed which usually feature huge eyes
an enlarged head and small body other stylistic elements are common as well often in comedic anime characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a face fault in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression angry characters may exhibit a vein or stressmark effect where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead angry women will sometimes summon a mallet from nowhere and strike someone with it leading to the concept of hammerspace male characters will develop
a bloody nose around their female love interests typically to indicate arousal this is supposedly due to blood rushing to the face in an exaggerated blush embarrassed characters will invariably produce a massive sweat drop which has become something of a stereotype of anime the degree of stylization varies from
title to title some titles make extensive use of common stylization flcl for example is known for its wild exaggerated stylization in contrast titles such as only yesterday a film by isao takahata take a much more realistic approach and feature no stylistic exaggerations another unique aspect of anime not found in other commercial animation markets is the lack of a directoral system in most animation produced around the world animators are all forced to conform to a set style by
the director or animation director in japan starting with the animation director yoshinori kanada as a means to save time and money each animator brings his her own style to the work the most extreme examples of this can be found in mindgame or the hakkenden the hakkenden is particularly extreme showing constantly shifting styles of animation
based upon the key animator that worked on that particular episode this approach combined with otsuka s money shots make
key animators important individuals in the style and production of an anime film many non japanese cartoons are
starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols to appeal to anime s tremendously growing fanbase and cut costs production types of anime most anime can be categorized as
one of three types films which are generally released in theaters represent the highest budgets and generally the highest video quality popular anime movies include akira ghost in the shell and spirited away some anime films are only released
at film or animation festivals and are shorter and sometimes lower in production values some examples of these are winter days and osamu tezuka s legend of the forest other types of films include compilation movies which are television episodes edited together and presented in theaters for various reasons and are hence a concentrated form of a television serial these may however be longer than the
average movie there are also theatrical shorts derived from existing televisions series and billed in japanese theaters together to form feature length showing television series anime is syndicated and broadcast on television on a regular schedule television series are generally low quality compared to ova original video animation and film titles because the production budget is spread out over many episodes rather than a single film or a
short series most episodes are about two three minutes in length to fill a typical thirty minute time slot with added commercials
one full season is two six episodes and many titles run half seasons or one three episodes most tv series anime episodes will have opening credits closing credits and often an eyecatch a very short scene often humorous
or silly that is used to signal the start or end of the commercial break as bumpers in the united states are used in a similar fashion eyecatch scenes are often found in tv series anime and are generally similar throughout the series ova original video animation sometimes oav or original animated video anime is often similar to a television miniseries ovas are typically two to twenty
episodes in length one shots are particularly short usually less than film length they are most commonly released directly to video as a general rule ova anime tends to be of high quality approaching that of films titles often have a very regular continuous plot best enjoyed if all episodes are viewed in sequence popular ova titles include flcl bubblegum crisis and tenchi muyo opening credits closing credits and eyecatches may sometimes be found in ova releases but not universally franchising it is very common for one title to spawn several different releases a title that starts as a
popular television series might then have a movie produced at a later date a good example is tenchi muyo originally an ova it spawned three movies three television series and several spinoff titles and specials not all successors to an anime are a sequel to the original story prequels and alternate stories are commonly adapted from the original licensing and distribution anime is available outside of japan in localized form licensed anime is modified by western distributors through dubbing into the language of the country the anime may also be edited to alter cultural references that may not
be understood by a non japanese person and companies may remove what may be perceived as objectionable content for the fans who may object to the editing and dubbing of anime dvds may be their preference dvd releases often include both the dubbed audio and the original japanese audio with subtitles are typically unedited and lack commercials fansubs although it is a
violation of copyright laws in many countries some fans watch fansubs recordings of anime series that have been subtitled by fans watching subtitled japanese versions is usually seen as the intended method of watching anime by enthusiasts the ethical implications of producing distributing or watching fansubs is a
topic of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from and cease distribution of their work once the series has been licensed see fansub for further discussion of ethical issues of fansubbing see also a

arabic often through other european languages especially spanish among them every day vocabulary like sugar sukkar cotton or magazine more recognizable are words like algebra alcohol and zenith see list of english words of arabic origin literary and modern standard arabic the term arabic may refer either to literary arabic or modern standard arabic or to the many localized varieties of arabic commonly called colloquial arabic arabs
consider literary arabic as the standard language and tend to view everything else as mere dialects literary arabic literally the most eloquent arabic language refers both to the language of present day media across north africa and the
middle east and to the more articulate language of the qur an the expression media here includes most television and radio and all written matter including all books newspapers magazines documents of every kind and reading primers for small children colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties derived from classical arabic spoken daily across north africa and the middle east which constitute the everyday spoken language these sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible these dialects are not typically written although a
certain amount of literature particularly plays and poetry exists in many of them they are often used to varying degrees in informal spoken media such as
soap operas and talk shows literary arabic or classical arabic is the official language of all arab countries and is the only form of arabic taught in schools at all stages the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school taught literary
arabic to an equal or lesser degree this diglossic situation facilitates code switching in which a speaker switches back and forth unaware between the two varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence in instances in which arabs of different nationalities engage in conversation only to find their dialects mutually unintelligible e g a moroccan speaking with a lebanese both should be
able to code switch into literary arabic for the sake of communication since the written arabic of today differs from the written arabic of the qur anic era it has become customary in western scholarship and among non arab scholars of arabic to refer to the language of the qur an as classical arabic
and the modern language of the media and of formal speech as modern standard arabic arabs on the other hand often
use the term to refer to both forms thus placing greater emphasis on the similarities between the two the difference between arabic
of the qur anic era and today s classical arabic is only in the degree of
eloquence the vocabulary the syntactic and grammatical rules are the same arabic and islam it is sometimes difficult to translate islamic concepts and concepts specific to arab culture without using the original arabic terminology the qur an is expressed in arabic and traditionally muslims deem it impossible to translate in a way that would adequately reflect
its exact meaning indeed until recently some schools of thought maintained that it should not be translated at all a list of islamic terms in arabic covers those terms which are too specific to translate in one phrase while arabic is strongly associated with islam and is the language of salah
it is also spoken by arab christians oriental jews and smaller sects such as
iraqi mandaeans even so a majority of the world s muslims do not actually speak arabic but only know some fixed phrases of the language such as those used in islamic prayer however to counteract this trend non arabic speaking muslims are strongly encouraged to learn the language classification and related languages maltese which is spoken on the mediterranean island of malta is the only surviving european language to derive primarily from arabic though it contains a large number of italian and english
borrowings dialects see varieties of arabic for main article colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken
languages or dialects of people throughout the arab world which as mentioned differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the maghreb dialects and those of the middle east followed by that between sedentary dialects and the much more conservative bedouin dialects maltese though descended
from arabic is considered a separate language speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of arabic in particular while middle easterners can generally understand one another they often have trouble understanding maghrebis although the converse is not true due to the popularity
of middle eastern especially egyptian films and other media one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order however a much more significant factor for most dialects is as among romance languages retention or change of meaning of different classical forms thus iraqi aku levantine fiih and

more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example non arabic is used in the maghreb dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names
semitic became extremely early on in arabic before it was written down a few modern arabic dialects such as iraqi influenced by persian distinguish between and interdental fricatives and are rendered
as stops and in some dialects principally levantine and egyptian and as and in learned words from the standard language early in the expansion of
arabic the separate emphatic phonemes and coallesced into a single phoneme becoming one or the other predictably dialects without interdental fricatives use exclusively while those with such fricatives use again in learned words from the standard language is rendered as in dialects without interdental fricatives another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render standard a voiceless uvular stop it retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered
regions such as yemen and morocco and among the druze while it is rendered in gulf arabic iraqi arabic upper egypt and less urban parts of the levant e g jordan and as a glottal stop in many prestige dialects such as those spoken in cairo beirut and damascus thus arabs instantly give away their geographical and class
origin by their pronunciation of a word such as qamar moon or grammar see arabic grammar writing system main article arabic alphabet the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic script which variety nabataean or syriac is a matter of scholarly dispute to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic script to greek script traditionally there were several differences between the western maghrebi and eastern version of the alphabet in particular the fa and qaf had a dot underneath and a single dot above respectively in the maghreb and the order
of the letters was slightly different at least when they were used as numerals however the old maghrebi
variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools zaouias of west africa arabic like other semitic languages is written from right to left calligraphy see arabic calligraphy for a fuller overview after the definitive fixing of the arabic script around seven eight six by khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi many styles were developed both for the writing down of the qur an and other books and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration arabic calligraphy has not fallen
out of use as in the western world and is still considered by arabs as a major art form calligraphers are held in great esteem being cursive by nature unlike the latin alphabet arabic script is used to write down a verse of the qur an a hadith or simply a proverb in a spectacular composition the composition is often abstract but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal two of the current masters
of the genre are hassan massoudy and khaled al saa i transliteration see arabic transliteration and arabic chat alphabet
for more information there are a number of different standards of arabic transliteration methods of accurately and efficiently representing arabic with the latin alphabet the more scientific standards allow the reader to recreate the exact word using the arabic alphabet however these systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as for the english sh sound at first sight this may be difficult to recognize less scientific systems often use digraphs like sh
and kh which are usually more simple to read but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems in some cases the sh or kh sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them that way they can be distinguished from separate s and h sounds or k and h sounds respectively compare gashouse to gash during the last few decades and
especially since the one nine nine zero s western invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant
messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin alphabet only and some of them still do not have the arabic alphabet as an optional feature
as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometime known as im arabic to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other
characters were appropriated for example the numeral three may be used to represent the arabic letter ayn there is no universal name for this type of transliteration but some have named it arabic chat alphabet other systems of transliteration exist such as using dots or capitalization to represent the emphatic counterparts of certain consonants for instance using capitalization the letter or daal may be represented by d its emphatic counterpart may be written as d literature kees versteegh the arabic language edinburgh university press one nine nine seven see also varieties of arabic learn standard

heart of darkness set during the vietnam war the film tells the story of a taciturn american soldier who is sent to terminate with extreme
prejudice the command of a rogue united states army special forces colonel the narrative of his journey and its culmination are studded with events which while bizarre are based on real vietnam stories the soldier s journey becomes increasingly nonlinear and hallucinatory coppola s agenda clearly involves larger themes the film s subtext concerns a journey into the darkness of the human psyche the film features performances by martin sheen as captain benjamin l willard marlow in conrad s novel marlon brando as colonel walter e kurtz dennis hopper as a fast talking
hallucinogen using photojournalist and robert duvall in an oscar nominated turn as the borderline psychotic lt colonel kilgore several other actors who were or later became prominent stars had minor or supporting roles in the movie including harrison ford r lee ermey and laurence
fishburne who only fourteen years old when shooting began in march one nine seven six was credited as larry fishburne the movie poster art
for apocalypse now is one of the more famous paintings by bob peak who is considered an influential artist in the world of film when it comes to movie posters background filmed in the philippines most notably the pagsanjan river and hidden valley springs the film went far over
budget and schedule a typhoon destroyed many of the sets the philippine air force helicopters used for shooting were constantly called back by president ferdinand marcos to be used in actual combat the lead role was recast martin sheen replaced harvey keitel after shooting had begun sheen then had a near fatal heart attack brando was intractable and out of shape and coppola himself was mentally fragile being similar in appearance and remarkably similar
in voice martin sheen s brother joe estevez stood in for the unwell sheen in much
of the film and some of the narration is by him after the first edit the film was six hours long and had to be severely edited the original released version was
just over two and a half hours long coppola re released the film in two zero zero one under the title apocalypse now redux restoring footage and sequences and lifting the running time to two zero zero

find colonel walter e kurtz a former member of the united states army special forces they state that kurtz once considered a model officer and future general
has apparently gone insane and is commanding a legion of his own montagnard troops deep in neutral cambodia their claims are supported by very disturbing radio broadcasts and or recordings made by kurtz himself willard is asked to undertake a mission to find kurtz and dispose of him with extreme prejudice willard studies the intelligence files during the boat ride to the river entrance and learns that kurtz isolated in his compound has assumed the role of a warlord and is worshipped by the natives and his own loyal men another officer sent earlier to kill kurtz has apparently
become one of his lieutenants willard will begin his trip up the mekong river on a pbr patrol boat river with an eclectic crew composed of by the book and formal chief phillips a black navy boat commander gm three lance

down the coast which marks the opening to the river is perfect for surfing a factor which persuades him to capture it the problem is his troops say it s charlie s point and heavily fortified dismissing this complaint with the explanation that charlie don t surf kilgore orders his men to saddle up in the morning so that the aircav can capture the town and the beach riding high
above the coast in a fleet of hueys accompanied by h six s kilgore

american outpost during a vietnamese attack against a wood bridge under construction there and the shocking deaths of both clean and chief phillips during a gunfire ambush with hidden viet cong soldiers and a spear thrown by a native on the shore respectively once arrived at kurtz s compound willard leaves chef behind with orders to call in an air strike on the village if he
does not return they are met by a borderline psychotic freelance photographer hopper who explains kurtz s greatness and philosophic skills to provoke his people into following him brought before kurtz and held in captivity in a darkened temple willard s constitution appears to weaken as kurtz lectures him on his theories of war humanity and civilization kurtz explains his motives and philisophy in a famous and haunting monolgue i ve seen horrors horrors
that you ve seen but you have no right to call me a murderer you have a right to kill me you have a right to do that but you have no right to judge me it s impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means horror horror has a face and you must make a friend of horror horror and moral terror are your friends if they
are not then they are enemies to be feared they are truly enemies i remember when i was with special forces seems a thousand centuries ago we went into a camp to inoculate the children we left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio and this old man came running after
us and he was crying he couldn t see we went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm there they were in a pile a pile of little arms and i remember i i i cried i wept like some grandmother i wanted to tear my teeth out i didn t know what i wanted to do and i want to remember it i never want to forget it i never want to forget and then i realized like i was shot like
i was shot with a diamond a diamond bullet right through my forehead and i thought my god the genius of that the genius the will to do that perfect genuine complete crystalline pure and then i realized they were stronger than we because they could stand that these were not monsters these were men trained cadres these men who fought with their hearts who had families who had children who were filled with love but they had the strength the strength to do that if i had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very
quickly you have to have men who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial
instincts to kill without feeling without passion without judgment without judgment because it s judgment that defeats us while bound outside in the pouring rain willard is approached by kurtz who places the severed head of chef in his lap coppola makes little explicit but we come to believe that willard and kurtz develop an understanding nonetheless kurtz wishes to die at willard s hands and willard having subsequently granted kurtz his wish is offered
the chance to succeed him in his warlord demigod role juxtaposed with a ceremonial slaughtering of a water buffalo willard enters kurtz s chamber during one of his message recordings and kills him with a machete this entire sequence is set to the end by the doors lying bloody and dying on the ground kurtz whispers the
horror the horror this line is taken directly from conrad s novella willard walks through the now silent crowd of natives until he comes upon lance who seems to have integrated himself into the society the two of them make their way to the pbr and float away as kurtz s final words echo in the wind as the screen fades to black redux in two zero zero one coppola released apocalypse now redux which restored four nine minutes of scenes that were cut from the original film including stopovers at a french rubber plantation wherein mr clean is
buried and a rain soaked american base camp nudity absent from the original was also included in the redux most notably at the french plantation and in an additional scene with the playboy playmates from the uso show in this version willard steals kilgore s surfboard which can still be seen briefly onboard the pbr in the original cut
alternate endings coppola denied having any actual alternative endings in the dvd commentary he states that they simply
had a massive amount of footage to edit with and thus had some choices to make they did consider using the explosion footage made during their destruction of the kurtz compound but he later decided that implying that the air strike had been called in was contrary to his wish to offer some slight hope that we could overcome the horrors of war however there are multiple slightly varying versions of the ending credits one version from the seven zero mm release ends with no credits and shows the boat pulling away another version for the three five mm wide
release rolls the credits while the kurtz compound is destroyed in what must be assumed was an air strike yet another version ends silently without the explosions and the credits roll over a black background themes apocalypse now is a thematically rich film the primary motif of the film is that of heart of darkness i e an odyssey into the darkness of humanity willard s constant
narration gives us a glimpse into his fractured psychological state particularly in the opening scenes where he lies in his bed and stares blankly into the ceiling he relates that he is on his second tour of duty and that he returned because he was unable to re integrate himself into civilian life saigon
shit i m still only in saigon every time i think i m gonna wake up back in the jungle when i was home after my first tour it was worse i d wake up and
there d be nothing i hardly said a word to my wife until i said yes to a divorce when i was here i wanted to be there when i was there all i could think of was getting
back into the jungle i m here a week now waiting for a mission getting softer every minute i stay
in this room i get weaker and every minute charlie squats in the bush he gets stronger each time i looked around the walls moved in a little tighter this chilling monologue besides suggesting how man is connected to war is also an allusion to post traumatic stress disorder a condition common to many
vietnam veterans willard s quest for kurtz s compound parallels kurtz s own descent into madness he never tells his fellow shipmates of the pbr the true purpose of the mission and in a chilling scene after his crew massacres people sailing on a sampan willard murders the surviving girl kurtz who was a committed family man and a highly respected colonel is driven insane after witnessing a vile incident commited by his enemies while on a peacekeeping mission he realised that he can never
win the war unless he surrenders his morality and kill without judgment for kurtz this action drove him insane and so he gathered other disillusioned soldiers and started a strange bizarre civilization in the cambodian forest this is
a subtle allusion to the bureaucracy that directs soldiers in the war the bureaucrats propagandized the vietnam war as a just cause to save the world from the evil of communism
the general public and several vietnam war veterans fiercely condemned the war and believed that the government lied and misled the public even willard who is assigned the mission is cynical about his mission from the beginning
charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the indy five zero zero the climax at kurtz s compound is the most confusing and the most frequently debated aspect of the film several critics believe it to be anticlimactic after the earlier more action oriented scenes and also the fact that it differs greatly from other war films in that there s no final battle scenario roger ebert in his original review defends the ending coppola doesn t have an
ending if we or he expected the closing scenes to pull everything together and make sense of it nobody should have been surprised apocalypse now doesn t tell any kind of a conventional story doesn t have a thought out message for us about vietnam has no answers and thus needs no ending the way the film ends
now with brando s fuzzy brooding monologues and the final violence
feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could when willard
arrives he is captured and put into containment as he is interrogated by kurtz who lectures and drones on about his philosophies while other interpretations exist it can be assumed that kurtz wishes to die a soldier s death and has been waiting for his death but his followers refuse to kill him and colby scott glenn who was sent to kill him
ended up joining his tribe he wishes or rather hopes that willard would be able to do so willard at first does not want to as he too is converted by kurtz s beliefs but after kurtz s monologue and his statement on judgment willard understands kurtz s desire and so decides to complete his mission by
subverting his moral judgment and justifies it to himself everybody wanted me to do it him most of all i felt like he was up there waiting for me to take
the pain away he just wanted to go out like a soldier standing up not like some poor wasted rag assed renegade even the jungle wanted him dead and that
s who he really took his orders from anyway the jungle is seen as a metaphor to nature or more specifically man s human nature after killing kurtz willard is revered by the denizens of kurtz s tribe but he instead leaves suggesting that perhaps he is capable of escaping the horror of war responses apocalypse now premiered in one nine seven nine to mixed reviews and received polarized responses from the audiences
it is said that it was as lauded as it
was reviled many critics slammed the film calling it overly pretentious while others felt that it ended anticlimatically after a splendid first
act roger ebert who hailed it as the best film of one nine seven nine and added it to his list of great movies stated apocalypse now is the best vietnam film one of the greatest of all films because it pushes beyond the others into the dark places of the soul it is not about war so much as about how war reveals truths we would be happy never to discover today the film is regarded by many as a masterpiece of the new hollywood
era it is on the afi s one zero zero years one zero zero movies list at number two eight kilgore s quote i love the smell of napalm in the morning was
number one two on the afi s one zero zero years one zero zero movie quotes list sight and sound magazine polled several critics to name the best film of the last two five years and apocalypse now was named number one the catastrophic production of the film unfortunately made it symbol of the dangers of excessive directorial control over a film the production was said to have taken a toll on coppola both mentally and emotionally to many cinephiles apocalypse now is the last great film of
a legendary director whose subsequent films have failed to match it in quality adaptation although inspired by joseph conrad s heart of darkness the film deviates extensively from it the novel takes place in the belgian congo in the one nine th century kurtz and marlow who is named willard in the movie are commercial agents of a belgian ivory company that brutally exploits its african native workers in the novel marlow is sent to bring the
ailing kurtz home in the movie willard is sent to kill kurtz the character of kilgore is an invention of the screenwriters nevertheless coppola has maintained many episodes the spear and arrow attack on the boat for example that respect the spirit of the novel and in particular its critique of the concept of civilization and progress the fact that coppola substituted european colonization with american interventionism does not change the universal message of the book influence as one of the most
iconic films of the two zero th century the film has been referenced and parodied countless times film the film was parodied in a short film called porklips

two nine april one nine eight zero was a british born film director and producer closely associated with the suspense thriller genre he began directing in the united kingdom before working mostly in the united states from one nine three nine onwards taking out dual citizenship in one nine five six he directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades from the silent film era through the invention of talkies to the color era hitchcock remains
one of the best known and most popular directors of all time famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense throughout his movies hitchcock s films draw heavily on both fear and fantasy
and are known for their droll humour they often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond
their control or understanding this often involves a transference of guilt in which the innocent character s failings are transferred to another character and magnified another common theme is the exploration of the compatibility of men and women hitchcock s films often take a cynical view of traditional romantic relationships although hitchcock was an enormous star during his lifetime he was not usually ranked highly
by contemporaneous film critics rebecca was the only one of his films to win the academy award for best picture although four others were nominated hitchcock never won the academy award for best director he was awarded the irving g thalberg memorial award
for lifetime achievement in one nine six seven but never personally received an academy award of merit the french new wave critics especially ric rohmer claude chabrol and fran ois truffaut were among the first to promote his films as having artistic merit beyond entertainment hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their auteur theory which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film making process through his fame public persona and degree of creative control hitchcock transformed the role of the director which had previously been eclipsed by that of the producer
he is seen today as the quintessential director who managed to combine art and entertainment in a way very few have ever matched his innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers producers and actors biography early life alfred hitchcock was born on august one three one eight nine nine in leytonstone london the second son and youngest of the three children of william hitchcock
a greengrocer and his wife emma jane hitchcock nee whelan his family was mostly irish catholic hitchcock was sent to catholic boarding schools in
london he has said his childhood was very lonely and sheltered at an early age after acting childishly hitchcock claimed that his father sent him to the local police station carrying a note when he presented the police officer on duty with the note he was
locked in a cell for a few moments petrifying the young child this was a favorite anecdote of his one which is often suggested to be the cause for the theme of distrust of police which runs through many of his films at one four hitchcock lost his father and left the jesuit run st ignatius college in stamford hill his school at the time to study at the school for
engineering and navigation after graduating he became a draftsman and advertising designer with a cable company about that time hitchcock became intrigued by photography and
started working in film in london in one nine two zero he obtained a full time job at islington studios under its american owners players lasky and their british successors gainsborough pictures designing the titles for silent movies pre war british career as a major talent in a new industry
with plenty of opportunity he rose quickly in one nine two five michael balcon of gainsborough pictures gave him a chance to direct his first film the pleasure garden made at the ufa studios in germany however the commercial failure of this film and his second the mountain eagle threatened to derail his promising career until he attached himself to the thriller genre the resulting film the lodger a story of the london fog was released in one nine two seven and was a major commercial
and critical success like many of his earlier works it was influenced by expressionist techniques he had witnessed first hand in germany in it attractive blondes are strangled and the new
lodger ivor novello in the bunting family s upstairs apartment falls under heavy suspicion this is the first truly hitchcockian film incorporating such themes as the wrong man following the success of the lodger hitchcock began his first efforts to promote himself in the media and hired a publicist to cement his growing reputation as one of the british film industry s rising stars in one nine two six he was to marry his assistant director alma reville they had a daughter patricia in one
nine two eight alma was hitchcock s closest collaborator she wrote some of his screenplays and worked with him on every
one of his films in one nine two nine he began work on blackmail his tenth film while the film was in production the studio decided to make it one of britain s first sound pictures with the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the british museum blackmail also began the hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as the backdrop to a story in one nine three three hitchcock was once again working
for michael balcon at gaumont british picture corporation his first film for the company the man who knew too much one nine three four was a success while
his second the three nine steps one nine three five is often considered one of the best films from his
early period it was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the macguffin a plot device around which a whole story would revolve in the three nine steps the macguffin is a stolen set of blueprints his next major success was in one nine three eight the lady vanishes a clever and fast paced film about the search for a kindly old englishwoman dame may whitty who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of vandrika a thinly veiled version of nazi germany by the end of the one nine three zero s
hitchcock was at the top of his game artistically and in a position to
name his own terms when david o selznick managed to entice the hitchcocks across to hollywood hollywood hitchcock s gallows humour continued in his american work together with the suspense that became his trademark however working arrangements with his new producer were less than optimal selznick suffered
from perennial money problems and hitchcock was often unhappy with the amount of creative control demanded by selznick over his films subsequently selznick ended up loaning hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing hitchcock s films himself with the prestigious picture rebecca in one nine four zero hitchcock made his first american movie although it was set in england and based on a novel by english author dame daphne du maurier this gothic melodrama explores the fears of a na
ve young bride who enters a great english country home and must grapple with a distant husband a predatory housekeeper
and the legacy of her husband s late wife it has also subsequently been noted for the lesbian undercurrents in judith anderson s performance the film won the academy award for best picture of one nine four zero hitchcock s second american film the european set thriller foreign correspondent was also nominated for best picture that year hitchcock s work during the one nine four zero s was very
diverse ranging from the romantic comedy mr charlie newton teresa wright who suspects her beloved uncle charlie spencer joseph cotten of murder in its use of overlapping characters dialogue and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential including jacques lacan and slavoj i ek the film also harkens to one of cotten s better known films citizen kane spellbound explored the then very fashionable subject of psychoanalysis and featured
a dream sequence which was designed by salvador dali the actual dream sequence in the film was considerably cut from the original planned scene that was to run for some minutes but proved too disturbing for the finished film notorious one nine four six marked hitchcock s first film as a producer as well as director as selznick failed to see the subject s
potential he allowed hitchcock to make the film for rko from this point on hitchcock would produce his own films giving him a far greater degree of freedom to pursue the projects that interested him starring ingrid bergman and hitchcock regular cary grant and featuring a plot about nazis uranium and south america notorious was a huge box office success and has remained one of hitchcock s most acclaimed films its inventive use of
suspense and props briefly led to hitchcock being under surveillance by the cia due to his use of uranium as a plot device rope his first color film came next in one nine four eight here hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment as he had done earlier with lifeboat he also experimented with exceptionally long takes up to ten minutes see themes and devices featuring james stewart in the leading role rope was
the first of an eventual four films stewart would make for hitchcock based on the leopold and loeb case of the one nine two zero s rope is also among the earliest openly gay themed films to emerge from the hays office controlled hollywood studio era under capricorn set in nineteenth century australia also used this short lived technique but to a more limited extent for these two films he formed a production company
with sidney bernstein called transatlantic pictures which folded after these two unsuccessful pictures peak years and decline with strangers on a train one nine five one his first epic film based on the novel by patricia highsmith hitchcock combined many of the best elements from
his preceding british and american films two men casually meet and speculate on removing people who are causing them difficulty one of the men though takes this banter entirely seriously with farley granger reprising some elements of his role from rope strangers continued the director s interest in the narrative possiblities of homosexual blackmail and murder three very popular films all starring grace kelly
followed dial m for murder was adapted from the popular stage play by frederick knott this was originally another experimental film with hitchcock using the technique of three d cinematography although the film was never released in this format rear window starred james stewart again as well as thelma ritter and raymond burr here the wheelchair bound stewart observes the movements of his neighbours across the courtyard and becomes convinced one of them has
murdered his wife like lifeboat and rope the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space stewart s tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set to catch a thief set in the french riviera starred kelly and cary grant in one nine five six hitchcock also remade his one nine three four film the man who knew too much this time
with james stewart and doris day one nine five eight
s vertigo again starred stewart this time with kim novak and barbara bel geddes the film was a commercial failure but has come to be viewed by many as one of hitchcock s masterpieces hitchcock followed vertigo with three very different films which were all massive commercial successes all are also recognised as among his very best films north by northwest one nine five nine psycho one nine six zero and the birds one nine six three the latter two were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks both by bernard herrmann the screeching strings in
the murder scene in psycho pushed the limits of the time and the birds dispensed completely with conventional instruments using an electronically
produced soundtrack these were his last great films after which his career slowly
wound down in one nine seven two hitchcock returned to london to film frenzy his last major success for the first time hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language which had before been taboo in one of his films failing health slowed down his output over the last two decades of his life family plot one nine seven six was his last film it related the escapades of madam blanche tyler played by barbara harris a fraudulent spiritualist and her taxi driver lover bruce dern making a living from her phony powers william devane and katherine helmond co starred
hitchcock was created a knight commander of the order of the british empire by queen elizabeth ii in the one nine eight zero new years honours he died just four months later on april two nine before he had the opportunity to be formally invested by the queen he was nevertheless entitled to be known as sir alfred hitchcock and to use the postnominal letters kbe because he remained a british subject when he adopted american citizenship in one nine five six alfred hitchcock died from renal failure in his bel air los angeles home aged eight
zero and was survived by his wife alma reville and their daughter patricia hitchcock o connell his body was cremated and apparently there was no public funeral or memorial service themes and devices hitchcock preferred the use of suspense over surprise in his films in surprise the director assaults the viewer with frightening things in suspense the director tells or shows things to the audience which the characters in the film do not know and then artfully builds tension around what will happen when the characters finally learn the truth further blurring the moral distinction between the innocent
and the guilty occasionally making this indictment clear hitchcock also makes voyeurs of his respectable audience in rear window one nine five four after l b jeffries played by james stewart has been staring across the courtyard at him for most of the film lars thorwald played by raymond burr confronts jeffries by saying what do you want of me burr might as well have been addressing the audience in fact shortly before asking this thorwald turns to face the camera directly for the first
time at this point audiences often gasp one of hitchcock s favourite devices for driving the plots of his stories and creating suspense was what he called the macguffin the plots of many of his suspense films revolve around a macguffin a detail which by inciting curiosity and desire drives the plot and motivates the actions of characters within the story but whose specific identity and nature is unimportant to the spectator of
the film in vertigo for instance carlotta valdes is a macguffin she never appears and the details of her death are unimportant to the viewer but the story about her ghost s haunting of madeleine elster is the spur for scottie s investigation of her and hence the film s entire plot in notorious the uranium that the main
characters must recover before it reaches nazi hands serves as a similarly arbitrary
motivation any dangerous object would suffice and state secrets of various kinds serve as macguffins in several of the spy films like the three nine steps most of hitchcock s films contain cameo appearances by hitchcock himself the director would be seen
for a brief moment boarding a bus crossing in front of a building standing in an apartment across the courtyard or appearing in
a photograph this playful gesture became one of hitchcock s signatures as a recurring theme he would carry a musical instrument especially memorable was the large double bass case that he wrestles onto the train at the beginning of strangers on a train in his earliest appearances he would fill in as an obscure extra standing in a crowd or walking through a scene in a long camera shot but he became more prominent in his later appearances as when he turns to see jane
wyman s disguise when she passes him on the street in stage fright and in stark silhouette in his final film family plot in another amusing cameo albeit just a photograph hitchcock s picture is seen in the before side of a newspaper weight loss ad in lifeboat see a list
of hitchcock cameo appearances hitchcock includes the consumption of brandy in nearly every sound film i ll get you some brandy drink this down just like medicine says james stewart s character to kim novak in vertigo in a real life incident hitchcock dared montgomery clift at a dinner party around the filming of i confess to swallow a carafe of brandy which caused his lead actor to pass out almost immediately this near obsession with brandy remains unexplained another almost inexplicable feature of any hitchcock film is the inclusion of a staircase of course stairways inspire many suspenseful moments
most notably farley granger s character visit to the murderer in strangers on a train or the detective s demise in the bates mansion in psycho however a completely nonfunctional staircase adorns the apartment of the james stewart character
in rear window as if hitchcock feels compelled to its inclusion by some unspoken superstition hitchcock seemed to delight in the technical challenges of filmmaking in lifeboat hitchcock sets the entire action of the movie in a small boat yet manages to keep the cinematography from monotonous repetition his trademark
cameo appearance was a dilemma given the claustrophobic setting so hitchcock appeared on camera in a fictitious newspaper ad for a weight loss product in spellbound two unprecedented point of view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took and outsized props for it to hold a bucket sized glass
of milk and a large wooden gun for added novelty and impact the climactic gunshot was hand colored red on some copies of the black and white print of the film rope one nine four eight was another technical
challenge a film that appears to have been shot entirely in a single
take the film was actually shot in eight takes of approximately one zero minutes each which was the amount of film that would fit
in a single camera reel the transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment hitchcock used those points to hide the cut and began the next take with the camera in the same place his one nine five eight film vertigo contains a camera trick that has been imitated and re used so many times by filmmakers it has become known as the hitchcock zoom although famous for inventive camera angles hitchcock generally avoided points of view that were physically impossible from a human perspective for example he would
never place the camera looking out from inside a refrigerator regarding hitchcock s sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors there was a persistent rumor that he had said that actors were cattle hitchcock later denied this typically tongue in cheek clarifying that he had only said that actors should be treated like cattle carole lombard tweaking hitchcock and drumming up a little publicity brought some cows along with her
when she reported to the set of mr and mrs smith hitchcock often
dealt with matters that he felt were sexually preverse or kinky and many of his films darring subverted the restrictive hollywood production code that prohibited any mention of homosexuality his character and its effects on his films hitchcock s films sometimes feature male characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers in north by northwest one nine five nine roger thornhill cary grant s character is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother

by a young man named norman bates played by anthony perkins who thought he was his own mother his last blonde heroine was french actress claude jade as the secret agent s worried daughter michele in topaz one nine six nine hitchcock saw that reliance on actors and actresses was a holdover from
the theater tradition he was a pioneer in using camera movement camera set ups and montage to explore the outer reaches of cinematic art most critics and hitchcock scholars including donald spoto and roger ebert agree that vertigo is probably the director s most personal and revealing film dealing with the obsessions of a man
who crafts a woman into the woman he desires vertigo explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography hitchcock often said that his personal favourite was shadow of a doubt his style of working hitchcock once commented the writer and i plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail and when we re finished all that s left to
do is to shoot the film actually it s only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise really the novelist has the best casting since he doesn t have to cope with the actors and all the rest hitchcock was often critical of his actors and actresses as well dismissing for example kim novak s
performance in vertigo and once famously remarking that actors were to be treated like cattle in response to being accused of saying actors are cattle he said i never said they were cattle i said they were to be treated like cattle the first book devoted to the director is simply named hitchcock it is a document of a one week

whip snake or more likely the tamil word anaikolra which means elephant killer as early spanish settlers in south america referred to the anaconda as matatoro or
bull killer it is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake s native habitat it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large asian pythons two species are well known the green anaconda eunectes murinus which has been reported at over one zero meters three two eight feet in length although most are considerably smaller although shorter than the longest recorded species the reticulated
python it is considerably heavier in fact it is the heaviest snake species in existence it can weigh two five zero kg five five one pounds and have a girth of more than three zero cm one one eight inches in diameter females are larger than males averaging two two two six feet and one two one six feet respectively these are found mainly in northern south america in venezuela
colombia brazil northern bolivia northeast peru guyana and trinidad although charismatic very little information was known about the anacondas until one nine nine two when the first study and so far the only was made on the field biology of this species in the venezuelan llanos by dr jesus rivas the yellow anaconda eunectes notaeus which reaches a relatively smaller average adult length of three metres nine eight feet these live further south in bolivia paraguay uruguay western brazil and northeast argentina the third lesser known species is the dark spotted or deschauense s anaconda
eunectes deschauenseei found in northeast brazil eunectes murinus formerly called boa murina differs from boa by the snout being covered with shields instead of small scales the inner of the three nasal shields being in contact with that of the other side the general colour is dark olive brown with large oval black spots arranged in two alternating rows along the back and with smaller white eyed spots along the sides the
belly is whitish spotted with black spots the anaconda combines an arboreal with an aquatic life and feeds chiefly upon
birds mammals and caiman mostly during the night it lies submerged in the water with only a small part of its head above the surface waiting for any suitable prey or it establishes itself upon the branches of a tree which overhangs the water or the track of game like almost all boas anacondas give birth to live young giant anacondas the largest known anacondas measure about one zero six meters three zero seven
feet long but unverified reports of much larger snakes have occasionally been made one notable account was reported by adventurer percy fawcett in one nine zero six fawcett wrote that he had shot and wounded an anaconda in south america he reported the snake measured some one eight nine meters six two feet from nose to tail once publicized fawcett s account of the giant snake was widely ridiculed
although he insisted his account was both truthful and accurate bernard heuvelmans came to his defense arguing that fawcett was generally honest and reliable when relating things furthermore heuvelmans noted that mainstream experts were repeatedly forced to revise
their limits regarding the maximum size of snakes when confronted with specimens that defied the generally accepted estimates at one point in time six meters two zero
feet in length was the widely accepted maximum size of an anaconda these giant snakes are very capable of killing and consuming an adult human being when it sheds an adult anaconda relieves itself of an average of two pounds of skin an anaconda s skin can stretch up to three zero larger than the
original size of the snake in captivity anacondas have a reputation for bad temperament that plus the massive size of the green species mean that anacondas are comparatively less popular as pets than other boas but they are fairly commonly available in the exotic pet trade with the exception of e deschauenseei references bernard heuvelmans on the track of unknown

all souls day altaic is a proposed language family which includes six zero languages spoken by about two five zero million people mostly in and around central asia and the far
east the relationships among these languages remain a matter of debate among historical linguists some scholars consider the obvious similarity between these languages as genetically inherited others propose the idea of the sprachbund its proponents traditionally considered it to include korean the turkic languages the mongolic languages the tungusic languages or manchu tungus and japanese ainu has occasionally been suggested as a member of altaic but that hypothesis is generally rejected castr n one

put forward more etymologies in the one nine two zero s korean has commonly been linked to japonic and in one nine seven one roy miller suggested relating it to both korean and altaic these suggestions have been taken up and developed by various historical linguists such as john whitman sergei starostin and alexander vovin who now rejects a genetic connection between korean and japanese there have been some attempts to extend the altaic family borders by including ainu e g street one nine six two patrie one nine eight two tamil nivkh or hungarian
but these proposals have been rejected by the majority of scholars controversy there are two main schools of thought about the altaic theory one is that the proposed constituent language families turkic mongolic and tungusic in the basic theory with the addition of korean and japanese in extended versions are genetically or divergently related by descent from a common ancestor proto altaic the other school rejects this theory so it is often called the anti altaic school and argues that the member languages are related by convergence mainly loan influence the
altaic theory is claimed by its opponents to be based mainly on typological similarities such as vowel harmony lack of grammatical gender an agglutinative typology and loanwords in fact
its proponents have put together a large variety of grammatical lexical and syntactic regular correspondences between the sub groups of altaic e g ramstedt poppe martin starostin however its opponents explain these as loanwords mutual influence or convergence arguing that although the turkic mongolian and tungusic families do have similarities they are the result of intensive borrowing and long contact among speakers the altaic theory is highly controversial while some support it others e g doerfer one nine six three
do not regard altaic as a valid group and see it as three or more separate language families other linguists such as bernard comrie one nine nine two two zero zero three argue that altaic may be part of a larger grouping such as nostratic or eurasiatic in contrast j marshall unger one nine nine zero believes that languages such as korean and japanese may be part of a

dialect which is not very styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of austria than other styrian dialects for example from western styria simple words in
the various dialects are very similar but pronunciation is distinct for each and it is very easy for
an austrian after a few spoken words to judge which austrian dialect someone speaks however if it goes into the dialects of the deeper valleys of tyrol sometimes even other tyroleans are helpless to understand the dialect speakers from the different states of austria can usually
easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents probably more so than bavarians with those of carinthia styria vienna upper austria and the tyrol being very characteristic speakers from those regions even those speaking standard german can usually be easily identified by their accent even by an untrained listener several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non germanic linguistic groups such as the dialect of carinthia where in the past many
speakers were bilingual with slovenian and the dialect of vienna which has been influenced by immigration during the austro hungarian period particularly from what is today the czech republic interestingly the geographic borderlines between the different accents coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border to bavaria
with bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language as such
standard german in austria with german being a pluricentric language austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of standard german spoken by most austrians which is distinct from that of germany or switzerland distinctions in vocabulary persist for example in culinary terms where communication with germans is frequently
difficult and administrative and legal language which is due to austria s exclusion from the development of a german nation state in the late one nine th century and its manifold particular traditions austrians speaking standard german can almost always be recognised by their accent much more so than speakers from most regions of germany when austria became a member of the european union the austrian variety of the german language limited to two three agricultural terms
was protected in the so called protocol no one zero regarding the use of specific austrian terms of the german language in the framework of the european union which forms part of the austrian eu accession treaty austrian german is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognised under international law eu primary law all facts concerning protocol no one zero are documented in markhardt heidemarie das sterreichische deutsch im rahmen der eu peter lang two zero zero five influence of popular culture dialects are receding in austria as they are in some
other areas of europe but it can safely be said that they are more persistent than in most of germany dialects are frequently used in tv series or movies in situation where it is appropriate for the particular character and situation a classic example of a strong form of viennese working class dialect for example would be ein echter
wiener geht nicht unter however strong varieties of dialect are not used quite as much as for example in switzerland for example educated people in vienna usually speak a very slight form of
dialect or simply standard german but with the characteristic viennese accent and where it exists particular austrian and viennese vocabulary a good
reference for the austrian bavarian and other german dialects are the dialect mundart editions of asterix and obelix comic books which are available in viennese three editions with different dialects from inside vienna and
at least one for the common tyrolean dialect and one for a deep styrian dialect see also austro bavarian viennese german high germanic languages languages of austria in mathematics the axiom of choice or ac is an axiom of set theory it was formulated in one nine zero four by ernst zermelo while it was originally controversial it is now used without embarrassment by
most mathematicians however there are still schools of mathematical thought primarily within set theory that either reject the axiom of choice or even investigate consequences of axioms inconsistent with ac intuitively speaking ac says that given a collection of bins each containing
at least one object then exactly one object from each bin can be picked and gathered in another bin even if there are infinitely many bins and there is no rule for which object to pick from each statement the axiom of choice states let x be a set of non empty sets then we can choose a member from each set in x stated
more formally let x be a set of non empty sets then there exists a choice function f defined on x in other words there exists a function f defined on x such that for each set s in x f s is an element of s another formulation of the axiom of choice states given any set of mutually disjoint non empty sets there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the non empty sets usage until the late one nine th
century the axiom of choice was often used implicitly for example after having established that the set x contains only non empty sets a mathematician might have said let f s be one of the members of s for all s in x in general it is impossible to prove that f exists without the axiom of choice but this seems to have gone unnoticed until zermelo not every situation requires the axiom of choice for finite sets x the axiom of choice follows
from the other axioms of set theory in that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several a finite number of boxes each containing at least one item then we can choose exactly one item from each box clearly we can do this we start at the first box choose an item go to the second box choose an item and so on there are only finitely many boxes so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end the result is an
explicit choice function a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose the second box to the second element we chose and so on a formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of mathematical induction for certain infinite sets x it is also possible to avoid the axiom of choice for example suppose that the elements of x are
sets of natural numbers every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it takes each set to the least element of that set this gives us a definite choice of an element from each set and we can write down an explicit expression that tells us what value our choice function takes any time it is possible to specify such an explicit choice the axiom of choice is unnecessary the difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each
set if we cannot make explicit choices how do we know that our set
exists for example suppose that x is the set of all non empty subsets of the real numbers first we might try to proceed as if x were finite if we try to choose an element from each set then because x is infinite our choice procedure will never come to an end and consequently we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of x so that
won t work next we might try the trick of specifying the least element from each set but some subsets of the real numbers don t have least elements for example the open interval zero one does not have a least element if x is in zero one then so is x two and x two is always strictly
smaller than x so taking least elements doesn t work either the reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are well ordered every subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element perhaps if we were clever we might say even though the usual ordering
of the real numbers does not work it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well ordering then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering the problem then becomes constructing such an ordering and it turns out that every set can be well ordered
if and only if the axiom of choice is true a proof requiring the axiom of choice is always nonconstructive even if the proof produces an object then it is impossible to
say exactly what that object is consequently while the axiom of choice asserts that there is a well ordering of the real numbers it does not give us an example of one yet the
reason why we chose above to well order the real numbers was so that for each set in x we could explicitly choose an element of that set if we cannot write down the well ordering we are using then our choice is not very explicit this is one of the reasons why some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice for example constructivists posit that all existence proofs should be totally explicit it should be possible to construct anything that exists they reject the axiom of choice because it asserts
the existence of an object without telling what it is independence of ac by work of kurt g del and paul cohen the axiom of choice is logically independent of the other axioms of zermelo fraenkel set theory zf this means that neither it nor its negation can be proven to be true in zf consequently assuming the axiom of choice or its negation will never lead to a contradiction that could not be obtained without that assumption so the decision whether or not it is appropriate to make use of the axiom of choice in
a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory the decision must be made on other grounds one argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it using it cannot hurt cannot result in
contradiction and makes it possible to prove some propositions that otherwise could not be proved the axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of zf for example the generalized continuum hypothesis gch is not only independent of zf but also independent of zf plus the axiom of choice zfc however zf plus gch implies ac making gch a strictly stronger claim than ac even though
they are both independent of zf one reason that some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of some bizarre counter intuitive objects an example of this is the banach tarski paradox which says in effect that it is possible to carve up the three dimensional solid unit ball into finitely
many pieces and using only rotation and translation reassemble the pieces into two balls each with the same volume as the original note that the proof like all proofs involving the axiom of choice is an existence proof
only it does not tell us how to carve up the unit sphere to make this happen it simply tells us that it can be done on the other hand the negation of the axiom of choice is also bizarre for example the statement that for any two sets s and t the cardinality of s is less than or equal to the cardinality of t or the cardinality of t is less than or equal to the cardinality of s is equivalent to the axiom of
choice put differently if the axiom of choice is false then there are sets s and t of incomparable size neither can be mapped in a one to one fashion onto a subset of the other a third possibility is to prove theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation a tactic preferred in constructive mathematics such statements will be true in any model of zermelo fraenkel set theory regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model this renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its
negation undecidable for example under such an assumption the banach tarski paradox is neither true nor false it is impossible to construct a decomposition of the unit ball which can be reassembled into two unit balls and it is also impossible to prove that it can t be done however the banach tarski paradox can be rephrased as a statement about models of zf by saying in any model of zf in
which ac is true the banach tarski paradox is true similarly all the statements listed below under results requiring ac are undecidable in zf but
since each is provable in any model of zfc there are models of zf in which each statement is true weaker forms of ac there are several weaker statements which are not equivalent to the axiom of
choice but which are closely related a simple one is the axiom of countable choice which states that a choice function exists for any countable set x this usually suffices when trying to make statements about the real numbers for
example because the rational numbers which are countable form a
dense subset of the reals see also the boolean prime ideal
theorem the ultrafilter lemma the axiom of dependent choice and the axiom of uniformization results requiring ac or weaker forms one of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up there are also a remarkable number of important statements
that assuming the axioms of zf but neither ac nor ac are equivalent to the axiom of choice the most important among them are zorn s lemma and the well ordering theorem every set can be well ordered in fact zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize
his proof of the well ordering principle here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the
sense that they are not provable from zf but are provable from zfc zf plus
ac equivalently these statements are true in all models of zfc but false in some models of zf set theory any union of countably many countable sets is itself countable if the set
a is infinite then there exists an injection from the natural numbers n to a if the set a is infinite then a and a a have the same cardinality this statement
is equivalent to ac over zf trichotomy if two sets are given then they either have the same cardinality or one has a smaller cardinality than the other this statement is equivalent to ac over zf the product of any nonempty family of nonempty sets is nonempty this statement is equivalent to ac over zf every infinite game g t x where x is either open or closed is determined measure theory the vitali theorem on the existence of non measurable sets the hausdorff paradox the banach tarski paradox algebra every vector
space has a basis this statement is equivalent to ac over zf every unital ring other than the trivial ring contains a maximal ideal every field has an algebraic closure every field extension has a transcendence basis every category has a skeleton stone s representation theorem for boolean algebras needs the boolean prime ideal theorem the nielsen schreier theorem
that every subgroup of a free group is free the additive groups of r and c are isomorphic functional analysis the hahn banach theorem in functional analysis allowing
the extension of linear functionals the theorem that every hilbert space has an orthonormal basis the banach alaoglu theorem about compactness of sets of functionals the baire category theorem about complete metric spaces and its consequences such as the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem general topology tychonoff s theorem stating that every product of compact topological spaces is compact this statement is equivalent to ac over zf in the product topology the closure of a product of subsets is equal to the product of the closures any product of complete uniform spaces is complete a
uniform space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded every tychonoff space has a stone cech compactification results requiring ac there are models of zermelo fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false we will abbreviate zermelo fraenkel set theory
plus the negation of the axiom of choice by zf c for certain models of zf c it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts note that any model of zf c is also a model of zf so for each of the following statements there exists a model of zf in which that statement
is true there exists a model of zf c in which there is a function f from the real numbers to the real numbers such that f is not continuous at a but for any sequence converging to
a lim n f xn f a there exists a model of zf c in which real numbers are a countable union of countable sets there exists a model of zf c in which there is a field with no algebraic closure in all models of zf c there is a vector space with no basis there exists a model
of zf c in which there is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities for proofs see thomas jech the axiom of choice
american elsevier pub co new york one nine seven three there exists a model of zf c in which every set in r n is measurable thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the banach tarski paradox which are provable
in zfc furthermore this is possible whilst assuming the axiom of dependent choice which is weaker than ac but sufficient to develop most of real analysis in all models of zf c the generalized continuum hypothesis does not hold results requiring choice in intuitionistic logic though not classically interestingly in various varieties of constructive logic in particular intuitionistic logic in which the law of excluded middle
is not assumed the assumption of the axiom of choice is sufficient to
obtain the law of excluded middle as a theorem to see this for any proposition p let u be the set x zero vee p and let v be the set x one
vee p see set builder notation by the axiom of choice there will exist a choice function f for the set
note that although the axiom of choice isn t classically required in order to obtain choice functions for finite sets it is necessary here in intuitionistic logic since f u in u and f v in v this
implies f u zero vee p wedge f v one vee p which implies f u neq f v vee p since p implies u v it must be that p implies f u f v so f u neq f v vee p would imply neg p vee p as this could be done for any proposition p this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle the above proof is not valid in all
intuitionistic deductive systems for example in the intuitionistic type theory of per martin l f the axiom of choice is a theorem yet excluded middle is not quotes the axiom of choice is obviously true
the well ordering principle obviously false and who can tell about zorn s lemma jerry bona this is a joke that although the axiom of choice the well ordering principle and zorn s lemma are mathematically equivalent most mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive the well ordering principle to be counterintuitive and zorn s lemma to be too complex for any intuition the axiom of choice is necessary to select a set from an infinite number of socks but not an infinite number of shoes
bertrand russell the observation here is that one can define a function to select from an infinite number of pairs of shoes by stating for example to choose the left shoe without the axiom of choice one cannot assert
that such a function exists for pairs of socks because left and right socks are presumably identical to each other the axiom gets its name not because mathematicians prefer it to other axioms a k dewdney from the famous april fool s day article in the computer recreations column of the scientific american april one nine eight nine external links there are many

empire died with him and he left no remarkable legacy he has become a legendary figure in the history of europe in much of western europe he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity in contrast some histories lionize him as a great and noble

was sent as a child hostage to the roman court of emperor honorius in return the huns received flavius aetius in a child hostage exchange arranged by the romans most likely the empire schooled attila in its courts customs and traditions and in its luxurious lifestyle in the hope that he would carry an appreciation of these things back to his own nation thus serving to extend roman influence the huns would probably have hoped that attila would enhance espionage
capabilities by the exchange attila attempted escape during his stay in rome but failed he turned his attention to an intense study of the empire while outwardly ceasing to struggle against his hostage status he studied the internal and foreign policies of the romans he often secretly observed them in diplomatic conference with foreign ministers he learned about leadership protocol and other essentials suited to future rulers and diplomats shared kingship the hunnish empire stretched from the steppes of central asia into modern germany and from the danube river to the baltic sea by four

during this time they were conducting an invasion of the persian empire however in armenia a persian counterattack resulted in a defeat for attila and bleda and they ceased their efforts to conquer persia in four four zero they reappeared on the borders of the empire attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the danube that had been arranged for by the treaty attila and bleda threatened further war claiming
that the romans had failed to fulfil their treaty obligations and that the bishop of margus not far from modern belgrade had crossed the danube to ransack and desecrate the royal hun graves on the danube s north bank they crossed the danube and laid waste to
illyrian cities and forts on the river among them according to priscus viminacium which was a city of the moesians in illyria their advance began at margus for

power again rode south into the empire through moesia the roman army under the gothic magister militum arnegisclus met him on the river vid and was defeated though not without inflicting heavy losses the huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the balkans as far

land stretching three hundred miles east from sigindunum belgrade and up to a hundred miles south of the danube negotiations continued between roman and hun for approximately three years the historian priscus was sent as emissary to attila s encampment in four four eight and the fragments of his reports preserved by jordanes offer the best glimpse of attila among his numerous wives his scythian fool and his moorish dwarf impassive and unadorned amid the splendor of the courtiers a luxurious meal served on
silver plate had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests but attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher in everything else too he showed himself temperate his cup was of wood while to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver his dress too was quite simple affecting only to be clean the sword he carried at his side the latchets of his scythian shoes the bridle of his horse were not adorned like those of the other scythians with gold or gems
or anything costly the floor of the room was covered with woollen mats for walking on priscus noted during these three years according to a legend recounted by jordanes attila discovered the sword of mars the historian priscus says it was discovered under
the following circumstances when a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass he dug it up and took it straight
to attila he rejoiced at this gift and being ambitious thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world and that through the sword of mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him jordanes the origin and
deeds of the goths ch xxxv e text later scholarship would identify this legend as part of a pattern of sword worship common among the nomads of the central asian steppes attila in the west an inaccurate sketch of attila the hun probably from the one nine th century depicts him as european though the only extant description of his appearance by a roman court historian states that atilla had a flat nose swarthy dark complexion broad chest short stature and small
eyes but full of confidence among his features suggesting physical features common among mongolians as late as four five zero attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful visigoth kingdom of toulouse in alliance with emperor valentinian iii he had previously been on good terms with the western empire and its de facto ruler flavius a tius aetius had spent a brief exile among the huns in four three three and the troops attila provided against the goths and bagaudae had helped earn him the largely
honorary title of magister militum in the west the gifts and diplomatic efforts of geiseric who opposed and feared the visigoths may also have influenced attila s plans however valentinian s sister honoria in order to escape her forced betrothal to a senator had sent the hunnish king
a plea for help and her ring in the spring of four five zero though honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage attila chose to interpret her message
as such he accepted asking for half of the western empire as dowry when valentinian discovered the plan only the influence of his mother galla placidia convinced him to exile rather than kill honoria he also wrote to attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal attila not convinced sent an embassy to ravenna to proclaim that honoria was innocent that the proposal had been legitimate and that he would come to claim what
was rightfully his meanwhile theodosius having died in a riding accident his successor marcian cut off the huns tribute in late four five zero and multiple invasions by the huns and by others had left the balkans with little to plunder the king of the salian franks had died and the succession struggle between his two sons drove a rift between attila and aetius attila supported the elder son while aetius supported the younger j b bury believes that attila s intent by the time he marched west was to
extend his kingdom already the strongest on the continent across gaul to the atlantic shore by the time attila had gathered his vassals gepids ostrogoths rugians scirians heruls thuringians alans burgundians et al
and begun his march west he had declared intent of alliance both with the visigoths and with the romans in four five one his arrival in belgica with an army exaggerated by jordanes to half a million strong soon made his intent clear on april seven he captured metz and aetius moved to oppose him gathering troops from among the franks the burgundians and the celts a mission by avitus and attila s continued westward advance convinced the visigoth king theodoric i theodorid to ally with the romans the combined armies reached orleans ahead
of attila thus checking and turning back the hunnish advance aetius gave chase and caught the huns at a place usually assumed to be near ch lons en champagne the two armies clashed in the
battle of chalons whose outcome commonly though erroneously is attributed to be a victory for the gothic roman
alliance theodoric was killed in the fighting aetius failed to press his advantage and the alliance quickly disbanded attila withdrew to continue his campaign against italy invasion of italy and death attila returned in four five two to claim his marriage to honoria anew invading and ravaging italy along the way his army sacked numerous cities and razed aquileia completely leaving no trace of it behind valentinian fled from ravenna to rome aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle attila
finally halted at the po where he met an embassy including the prefect trigetius the consul aviennus and pope leo i after the meeting he turned his army back having claimed neither honoria s hand nor the territories he desired raphael s the meeting between leo the great and attila shows leo i with saint peter and saint paul above him going to meet attila several explanations for his actions have been proffered the plague and famine which coincided with his invasion may have caused his army to weaken
or the troops that marcian sent across the danube may have given him reason to retreat or perhaps both priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of alaric who died shortly after sacking rome in four one zero gave the hun pause prosper of aquitaine s pious fable which has been represented by the pencil of raphael and the chisel of algardi as gibbon called it says that the pope aided by saint peter and saint
paul convinced him to turn away from the city various historians e
g isaac asimov have supposed that the embassy brought a large amount of gold to the hunnish leader and persuaded him to abandon his campaign whatever his reasons attila left italy and returned to his palace across the danube from there he planned to strike at constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which marcian had cut off however he died in the early months of four five three the conventional account from priscus says that on the night after a feast celebrating his latest marriage to a beautiful goth named
ildico he suffered a severe nosebleed and choked to death in a stupor an alternative to the nosebleed theory is that he succummed to internal bleeding after heavy drinking his warriors upon discovering his death mourned him by cutting off their hair and gashing themselves with their swords so that says jordanes the greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears but with the blood of men his horsemen galloped in circles around the silken tent when
attila lay in state singing in his dirge according to cassiodorus and jordanes who can rate this as death when none believes it calls for vengeance then celebrating a strava over his burial place with great feasting he was buried in a triple coffin of gold silver and iron with the spoils of his conquest and his funeral party was killed to keep his burial place secret after his death he lived on as a legendary figure the characters of etzel in the nibelungenlied and atli in both the volsunga saga
and the poetic edda were both loosely based on his life an alternate story of his death first recorded eighty years after the fact by the roman chronicler count marcellinus reports attila rex hunnorum europae orbator provinciae noctu mulieris manu cultroque confoditur attila king of the huns and ravager of the provinces of europe was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife the volsunga saga and the poetic edda claim that king atli died at the hands of his wife gudrun most scholars reject these accounts as no
more than romantic fables preferring instead the version given by attila s contemporary priscus the official account by priscus however has recently come under renewed scrutiny by michael a babcock the night attila died solving the murder of attila the hun
berkley books two zero zero five isbn zero four two five two zero two seven two zero based
on detailed philological analysis babcock concludes that the account of natural death given by priscus was an ecclesiastical cover story and that emperor marcian who ruled the eastern roman empire from four five zero four five seven was the political force behind attila s death his sons ellak his appointed successor dengizik and ernakh fought over the division of his legacy what warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate and divided were defeated and scattered the
following year in the battle of nedao by the gepids under ardaric whose
pride was stirred by being treated with his people like chattel and the ostrogoths attila s empire did not outlast him appearance character and name atilla from an illustration to the poetic edda the main source for information on attila is priscus a historian who traveled with maximin on an embassy from theodosius ii in four four eight he describes the village the nomadic huns had built and settled down in as the size of the great city with solid wooden walls he described attila himself as short of stature with a broad chest and a large
head his eyes were small his beard thin and sprinkled with gray and he had a flat nose and a swarthy complexion showing the evidences of his origin attila s physical appearance was most likely that of an eastern asian or more specifically a mongol or perhaps a mixture of this type and the turkic peoples of central asia indeed he
probably exhibited the characteristic eastern asian facial features which europeans were not used to seeing and so they often described him in harsh terms attila is known in western history and tradition as the grim scourge of god and his name has become a byword for cruelty and
barbarism some of this may arise from a conflation of his traits in the popular imagination with those perceived in later steppe warlords such as the mongol great khan genghis khan and tamerlane all run together as cruel clever and sanguinary lovers of battle and pillage the reality of his character may be more complex the huns of attila s era had been mingling with roman civilization for
some time largely through the germanic foederati of the border so that by the time of theodosius s embassy in four four eight priscus could identify hunnic gothic and latin as the three common languages of the horde priscus also recounts his meeting with an eastern roman captive who had so fully assimilated into the huns way of life that he had no desire to return to his former country and the byzantine historian s description of attila s humility and simplicity is unambiguous in its admiration the historical context of attila s life played
a large part in determining his later public image in the waning years of the western empire his conflicts with aetius often called the last of the romans and the strangeness of his culture both helped dress him in the mask of the ferocious barbarian and enemy of civilization as he has been portrayed in any number of films and other works of art the germanic epics in which he appears offer more nuanced depictions he is both a noble and generous
ally as etzel in the nibelungenlied and a cruel miser as atli in the volsunga saga and the poetic edda some national histories though always portray him favorably in hungary and turkey the names of attila sometimes as atilla in turkish and his last wife ildik remain popular to this day in a similar vein the hungarian

the aegean sea is an arm of the mediterranean sea located between the greek peninsula and asia minor it is connected to the marmara sea and black sea by the dardanelles and bosporus etymology in ancient times there were various explanations for the name aegean it was said to have been named after the town of aegae or aegea a queen

names mediterranean a clockwork orange book cover this article describes the novel by anthony burgess for other uses of the term clockwork orange see clockwork orange disambiguation a clockwork orange is a science fiction and dystopian one nine six two novel by anthony
burgess and forms the basis for the one nine seven one film adaptation by stanley kubrick it is one of burgess s terminal novels written to provide posthumous income for his wife after burgess had allegedly been diagnosed
with an inoperable brain tumour burgess wrote that the title came from an old cockney expression as queer as a clockwork orange due to his time serving the british colonial office in malaya burgess thought that the phrase could be used to punningly refer to a mechanically responsive clockwork non human orang malay for person the italian title un arancia ad orologeria was interpreted to
refer to a grenade burgess wrote in his later introduction a clockwork orange resucked that a creature who can only perform good or evil is a clockwork orange meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by god or the devil in his essay clockwork oranges he says that this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of pavlovian or mechanical laws to an organism which like a fruit was capable of
colour and sweetness this title alludes to the protagonist s negatively conditioned responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his free will the book was partly inspired by an event in one nine four four when burgess pregnant wife lynne was robbed and beaten by four u s gi deserters in a london street suffering a miscarriage and chronic gynaecological problems according to burgess writing the novel was both a catharsis and an act of charity towards his wife s attackers the story is narrated by and essentially sympathetic to one of the attackers rather
than their victim synopsis set in the near future the book centres around the life of the fifteen year old protagonist alex delarge alex and his gang roam the streets at night committing crimes purely for enjoyment the crimes described in the book increase in severity from assault
to robbery to a fight with rival gang culminating when the gang breaks into the house of f d alexander and rapes his wife the gang returns to a bar where alex hits one of his gang members dim as punishment for dim s rude behaviour towards a woman who was singing the chorus of ode to joy classical music being alex s other passion apart from violence
this sparks off a tense moment between the two gang members the next day after fighting dim and george to re establish his control of the gang following the previous night s dispute alex agrees on pete s suggestion to
rob a house in a rich part of town alex tries to persuade the woman living in the house to open the door the woman refuses and calls the police as a precaution he gains access to the house through a window but is confronted by the defiant woman who
defends herself with unexpected strength he goes for a bust of beethoven and she scratches his face he manages to knock her out with a silver
statue he had previously taken as he runs out the front door he is struck by dim who runs off
with the rest of the gang just as the police arrive at the police station we learn that the woman has died in prison alex hears about an experimental rehabilitation programme called the ludovico technique which promises that the prisoner will be released upon completion of the two week treatment and
will not commit crimes afterwards and manages to become the first patient the ludovico technique itself is a form of aversion therapy
where alex is given a drug that induces extreme nausea while being forced to watch graphically violent films at the end of the treatment alex is unable to carry out or even contemplate violent acts as doing so induces crippling nausea he is released from prison but upon returning home he is rejected by his parents dejected alex contemplates suicide going to the public library in order to discover what
sort of poison he might take to end his life there he is spotted by one of his former victims who accompanied by his friends extracts his revenge alex
is unable to strike back and the police is alerted the police arrive but they turn out to be dim and billy boy the former leader of a rival gang they take alex beat him up and dump him by the side of the road out in the country alex stumbles to the nearest house for help which turns out to be that of
f d alexander whose wife alex had raped and beaten earlier in the book at first alex is not recognised as he had always worn a
mask but the reader discovers that f d alexander is in a wheel chair and his wife died from her injuries realising that alex is the same
person who had attacked him and his wife some years ago f d alexander drugs him locks him in a room and plays beethoven s nine th symphony at full volume although previously his favourite piece of music the ninth was also used as a soundtrack for one of the films that alex was forced to watch as part of the
ludovico treatment hence it produces the same nauseating effects on him unable to stand the pain alex throws himself out of the window to try to kill himself he survives the fall with broken bones and wakes up in hospital informed that his tormentors have been arrested and the ludovico treatment reversed the final chapter begins identically to the first alex having formed a new gang and reverted
to his previous criminality but on this particular night he decides not to join them and goes for a walk on his own instead in a cafe he bumps into one of his old gang member pete who is married and has become a respectable member of society pete s wife giggles at alex s
rhetoric and asks pete why does he speak like that after conversing with pete and his wife alex has an epiphany renouncing violence on one hand but on the other concluding that his behaviour was an unavoidable part of youth and that if he had a son he would not be able to stop him from doing what
he did although the book is divided into three parts each containing seven chapters twenty one being a symbolic number as it was the age that which a child earns his rights at the time the two one st chapter was omitted from the versions published in the us
the film adaptation which was directed by stanley kubrick follows the american version of the book ending prior the events of the two one st chapter kubrick claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay but that he certainly never gave
any serious consideration to using it analysis the book narrated by alex contains many words in a slang dialect
which burgess invented for the book called nadsat it is a
mix of modified russian words english slang and words invented by
burgess himself it serves two functions firstly burgess while wanting to provide his young characters with their own register did not want to use contemporary slang fearing that this would date the book too much secondly the
novel graphically describes horrific scenes of violence which would be shocking even by today s standards so nadsat is used as a linguistic veil to distance the reader from the action on the page influence both the story and individual elements have had a strong influence on popular culture in general and popular music in particular trivia alex s age at the end of the novel is the same age that the burgesses miscarried child would have been at the date of publication had the child survived the attack
on lynne been born and grown up the allegedly cockney phrase a clockwork orange is totally unknown to history the first recorded use of it is burgess s title quoted in a rolling stone article burgess claimed to have first heard the expression from a very old cockney in one nine four five burgess claimed that he had typed the title a clockwork orange and then sat down to think of a story to
go with it one early idea apparently involved a strike or riot among apprentices under elizabeth i as with many writers and their most popular books this was one of burgess s least favourite of the books he wrote and he thought it was overrated since in a clockwork orange the author f alexander wrote a book entitled a clockwork orange and it is his wife who is attacked by the droogs it seems likely burgess directly inserted some
of his own feelings and characteristics into the novel in the form of this character see also a clockwork orange film aestheticization of violence nadsat a fictional slang used in the book dystopia references a clockwork orange a play with music century hutchinson ltd one nine eight seven an extract is quoted on several web sites burgess

on july three one eight eight six in mannheim gottlieb daimler and wilhelm maybach in stuttgart also inventors of the first motor bike and in one eight eight eight eight nine german austrian inventor siegfried marcus in vienna although marcus didn t go beyond the prototype stage steam powered vehicles steam powered self propelled cars were devised in the late one eight th century the first self propelled car was built by nicolas joseph cugnot in one seven six nine it could attain speeds of up to six km h in one seven seven
one he designed another steam driven car which ran so fast that it rammed into a wall producing the world s first car accident the internal combustion engine in one eight zero six fransois isaac de rivaz a swiss designed the first internal combustion engine sometimes abbreviated ice today he subsequently
used it to develop the world s first vehicle to run on such an engine one that used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen to generate energy it was not very successful as was the case with the british inventor brown and the american inventor morey who produced clumsy ic engine powered vehicles about one eight two six etienne lenoir produced the first successful internal combustion engine in one eight six zero and within a few years about four zero zero were in operation in paris in about one eight six three
lenoir installed his engine in a vehicle it seems to have been powered by city lighting gas in bottles and was said by lenoir to have travelled slower than a man could walk with breakdowns being frequent lenoir in his patent of one eight six zero included the provision of a carburettor so liquid fuel could be substituted for gas particularly for
mobile purposes i e vehicles lenoir is said to have tested liquid fuel such as alcohol in his stationary engines but it doesn t appear he used them in his vehicle if he did he most certainly didn t use gasoline as this was not well known and was considered a waste product the next innovation comes in the late one eight six zero s with siegfried marcus a german working
in vienna austria he developed the idea of using gasoline as a fuel in a two stroke internal combustion engine in one eight seven zero he built a crude vehicle with no seats steering or brakes but it was spectacular for one reason it was the world s first internal combustion engine powered vehicle fueled by gasoline it was tested in vienna in september of one eight seven zero in one eight eight eight one eight eight nine he built
a second car this one with seats brakes and steering and a four stroke engine of his own
design the four stroke engine had already been written down and patented in one eight six two by the frenchman beau de rochas in a long winded and rambling pamphlet he printed about three zero zero copies of his pamphlet and they were distributed in paris
but nothing came of this with the patent expiring soon after and the pamphlet disappearing into total obscurity in fact hardly anyone knew of it to begin with beau de rochas never built a single engine most historians agree that nikolaus otto of germany built the world s first four stroke engine he knew nothing of beau de rochas s patent or idea and came upon the idea entirely on his own in fact he began thinking about it in one
eight six one but abandoned the idea until the mid one eight seven zero s there is some evidence although not conclusive that one christian reithmann an austrian living in germany had built a four stroke engine
entirely on his own by one eight seven three reithmann had been experimenting with ic engines as early as one eight five
two in one eight eight three edouard delamare deboutteville and leon malandin of france installed an internal combustion engine powered by a tank of city gas on a tricycle as they tested the vehicle the tank hose came loose resulting in an explosion in one eight eight four delamare deboutteville and malandin built and patented a second vehicle this one consisted of two four stroke liquid fueled engines mounted to an old four wheeled horse cart the patent and presumably the vehicle contained many innovations some of which wouldn t be used for decades however during the
vehicle s first test the frame broke apart the vehicle literally shaking itself to pieces in malandin s own words no more vehicles were built by the two men and their venture went completely unnoticed and their patent unexploited no one else knew of the vehicles and experiments until years later supposedly in the late one eight seven zero s an italian named murnigotti patented the idea of installing an ic engine on a vehicle although there is no evidence one
was built in one eight eight four enrico bernardi another italian installed an ic engine on his son s tricycle although nothing more than a toy it is said to have operated somewhat successfully in one source but another says the engine s power was too feeble to make the vehicle move but if all of the above experiments hadn t taken place the development of the automobile wouldn t have been retarded by so much as a moment since they were unknown experiments that went no further than the testing stage the internal combustion engined car really can
be said to have begun with benz and daimler in one eight eight six for their vehicles were successful they went into series production and they inspired others benz after building his first three wheeled car in one
eight eight five built improved versions in one eight eight six and one eight eight seven and went into production in one eight eight eight the world s first vehicle to do so approximately two five were built until one eight nine three when his first four wheeler was introduced they were powered with four stroke engines of his own design emile roger of france already producing benz engines under license now added the benz car to his line of products because france was more open to the automobile in general more were built and sold in france than by
benz himself in germany daimler built a car in one eight eight six a new horse carriage fitted with his new high speed four stroke engine in one eight eight nine he built two vehicles from scratch with several innovations from about one eight nine zero one eight nine five about three zero vehicles were built by daimler and his innovative assistant maybach either at the daimler works or in
the hotel hermann where they set up shop after having a falling out with their backers in one eight nine zero emile levassor and armand peugeot of france began series producing vehicles with daimler engines and so laid the foundation of the motor industry in france they were inspired by daimler s stalhradwagen of one eight eight nine which was exhibited in
paris in one eight eight nine the first american automobile with gasoline powered internal combustion engines was supposedly designed in one eight seven
seven by george baldwin selden of rochester new york who applied for a patent on the automobile in one eight seven nine selden didn t build a single car until one nine zero five when he was forced to do so due to the lawsuit selden received his patent and later sued the ford motor company for infringing his patent henry ford was notoriously against the american patent system and selden s case against ford went all the way to the supreme court who ruled that ford and everyone else was free to build
automobiles without paying royalties to selden since automobile technology had improved since selden s patent and no one was building those antiquated designs meanwhile notable advances in steam power evolved in birmingham england by the lunar society it was here that the term horsepower was first used it was in birmingham
also that the first british four wheel petrol driven automobiles were built in one eight nine five by frederick william lanchester who also patented the disc brake in the city electric vehicles were produced by a small number of manufacturers innovation

affordable automobiles was debuted by oldsmobile in one nine zero two then greatly expanded by henry ford in the one nine one zero s development of automotive technology was rapid due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world s attention key developments included electric ignition and the electric self starter both by charles kettering for the cadillac motor

has gone through a number of changes cars are not merely continually perfected mechanical contrivances since the one nine two zero s nearly all have been mass produced to meet a market so marketing plans and manufacture to meet them have often dominated automobile design it was alfred p sloan who established the idea
of different makes of cars produced by one firm so that buyers could move up as their fortunes improved the makes shared parts with one another so that the larger production volume
resulted in lower costs for each price range for example in the one nine five zero s chevrolet shared hood doors roof and windows with pontiac the lasalle of the one nine three zero s sold by cadillac used the cheaper mechanical parts made by the oldsmobile division alternative fuels and batteries with heavy taxes on fuel particularly in europe and tightening environmental laws particularly in california and the possibility of further restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions work on alternative power systems for vehicles continues diesel powered cars can run
with little or no modification on one zero zero pure biodiesel a fuel that can be made from vegetable oils many cars that currently use gasoline can
run on ethanol a fuel made from plant sugars most cars that are designed to run on gasoline are
capable of running with one five ethanol mixed in and with a small amount of redesign gasoline powered vehicles can run on ethanol concentrations as high as eight five all petrol fuelled cars
can run on lpg there has been some concern that the ethanol gasoline mixtures prematurely wear down seals and gaskets further the use of higher levels of alcohol requires that the automobile carry use twice as much therefore if your vehicle is capable of three zero zero miles on a one five gallon tank the efficiency is reduced to approximately one five zero miles of course certain measures are available to increase this efficiency such as different camshaft configurations altering the timing spark output
of the ignition or simply using a larger fuel tank in the united states alcohol fuel was produced in corn alcohol stills until prohibition
criminalized the production of alcohol in one nine one nine brazil is the only country which produces ethanol running cars since the late one nine seven zero s attempts at building viable battery powered electric vehicles continued throughout the one nine nine zero s notably general motors with the ev one but cost speed
and inadequate driving range made them uneconomical battery powered cars have used lead acid batteries which are greatly damaged in their recharge capacity if discharged beyond seven five on
a regular basis and nimh batteries current research and development is centered on hybrid vehicles that use both electric power and internal combustion the first hybrid vehicle available for sale in the usa was the honda insight as of two zero zero five the car

stop reducing the safe intervehicle gap six four fold if high speed roads incorporated a steel rail for emergency braking both safety modifications of the roadway are thought to be too expensive by most funding authorities although these modifications could dramatically increase the number of vehicles that could safely use a high speed highway early safety research focused on increasing the reliability of brakes and reducing the flammability of fuel systems for example modern engine compartments are open at the bottom so that fuel vapors which are heavier than air vent to
the open air brakes are hydraulic so that failures are slow leaks rather than abrupt cable breaks systematic research on crash safety started in one nine
five eight at ford motor company since then most research has focused on absorbing external crash energy with crushable panels and reducing the motion of human bodies in the passenger compartment there are standard tests for safety in new automobiles like the euroncap and the us ncap tests there are also tests run by organizations such as iihs and backed by the insurance industry despite technological advances there is still significant loss of life from car accidents about four zero zero zero zero people die every year in the u s
with similar figures in europe this figure increases annually in step with rising population and increasing travel if no measures are taken but the rate per capita and per mile travelled decreases steadily the death toll is expected to nearly double worldwide by two zero two zero a much higher number
of accidents result in injury or permanent disability the highest accident figures are reported in china and india the european union has a rigid program to cut the death toll in the eu in half by two zero one zero and member states have started implementing measures current production in two zero zero five six three million cars and light trucks were produced worldwide the world s biggest car producer including light trucks is the european union with two nine of the world s production in non
eu eastern europe another four are produced the second largest manufacturer is nafta with two five eight followed by japan with one six seven china with eight one mercosur with three nine india with two four and the rest of the world with one zero one vda link large free trade areas like eu nafta and mercosur attract manufacturers
worldwide to produce their products within them and without currency risks or customs additionally to being close to customers thus the production figures do not show the technological ability or business skill of the areas in fact much if not most of the third world car production is used western technology and car models and sometimes even complete obsolete western factories shipped to the country
which is reflected in the patent statistic as well as the locations of the r d centers the automobile industry is dominated by relatively few large corporations not to be confused with the much more numerous brands the biggest of which by numbers of produced cars are currently general motors toyota and ford motor company it is expected that toyota will reach the no one position in two zero zero six the most profitable per unit carmaker of recent years has been porsche due to
their premium price tag the automotive industry at large still suffers from high under utilization of its manufacturing potential future of the
car in order to limit deaths there has been a push for self driving automobiles much of the drive for computer driven vehicles has been led by darpa with their grand challenge race a current and powerful invention was esp by bosch and many
followers that reduces deaths by about three zero and is recommended by many lawmakers and carmakers to be a standard feature in all cars sold in the eu esp recognizes dangerous situations and corrects the drivers input for a short moment to stabilize the car the biggest threat to automobiles is the declining supply
of oil which does not completely stop car usage but makes it significantly more expensive beginning of two zero zero six a gallon of gas costs approx six us in germany and other european countries if no cheap solution can be found in the relatively near future individual mobility might suffer a
major setback nevertheless individual mobility is highly prized in modern societies so the demand for automobiles will remain just with a different power source looking at automotive technology some areas appear to have the most need of development for example both the rubber tires and the batteries currently used by most cars seem rather antiquated when compared to say modern day engines and traction control systems these are like jets with cardboard wings or pcs with one zero kb hard drives respectively while slow moving cars can
control their wheels via esp reasonably well fast moving vehicles like a bugatti veyron need a
special tire checkup before approaching four zero zero km h also the existing batteries are barely fit to handle the cars electronics but are far off from the ability to store enough energy for moving the car unassisted see also

automobile show from the bbc uk automotive industry portal automobiles audi logo audi is an automobile maker in germany and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the volkswagen group the company is headquartered in ingolstadt bavaria germany audi s german tagline is vorsprung durch technik the tagline is used either in original or in its english translation progress through technology history press photograph of the then newly merged audi nsu range one nine six nine the origins of audi the company traces its origins back to
one eight nine nine and august horch the first horch automobile was produced in one nine zero one in zwickau in former east germany in one nine one zero horch was forced out of the company he had founded he then started a new company in zwickau and continued using the horch brand his former partners sued him for trademark infringement and a german court determined that the horch brand belonged to his former company august horch
was forced to refrain from using his own family name in his new car business as the word horch translates to listen in
german august horch settled on the latin equivalent of his name audi it is also popularly believed that audi is an acronym which stands for auto union deutschland ingolstadt audi produces over two million vehicles annually at its main production site in ingolstadt audi has another production plant in neckarsulm audi started with a two six one two cc model followed by a four cylinder model with three five six four cc as well as four six eight zero cc and five seven two zero cc models these cars were successful even
in sporting events august horch left the audi company in one nine two zero the first six cylinder model four six five five cc appeared in
one nine two four in one nine two eight the company was acquired by j s rasmussen owner of dkw who bought the same year the remains of the us automobile manufacturer rickenbacker including the manufacturing equipment for eight cylinder engines these engines were used in audi zwickau and audi dresden models that were launched in one nine two nine at the same time six cylinder and a small four cylinder licensed from peugeot models were manufactured audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork the auto union era in one nine three two
audi merged with horch dkw and wanderer to form the auto union before world war ii auto union used the four interlinked rings that make up the audi badge today representing these four brands this badge was used however only on auto union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems the technological development became more and more concentrated and some audi models were propelled by horch or wanderer built engines pause and a new start auto union plants were heavily bombed and partly destroyed
during world war ii after the war zwickau soon became part of the german democratic republic and audi headquarters were moved to ingolstadt in that period the four interlinked rings were used together with the dkw badge the company focused efforts on the dkw brand but their two stroke engines became unpopular in one nine five eight daimler benz acquired eight eight per cent of auto union and the next year became its sole owner daimler benz developed a seven two hp five four kw four door sedan with a modern four stroke engine driving the front wheels this model
appeared in september one nine six five relaunching the audi brand daimler benz
sold the company to volkswagen in one nine six four subsequently volkswagen s purchase of auto union has led to the modernization of vw to which it gained expertise in manufacturing water cooled vehicles today aircooled powerplants once produced by vw are no longer placed into production vehicles since december two three two zero zero five audi six zero one nine six eight one nine seven
two in one nine six nine audi merged with nsu based in neckarsulm near stuttgart in the one nine five
zero s nsu had been the world s largest manufacturer of motorcycles but had moved on to produce small cars like the nsu prinz the tt and tts versions are still popular as vintage race cars nsu then focused on new rotary engines according to the ideas of felix wankel in one nine six seven the new nsu ro eight zero was a space age car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics light
weight safety et cetera but teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of nsu presently several lines of audi cars are produced in neckarsulm the mid sized car that nsu had been working on the k seven zero was intended to slot between the rear engined prinz models and the futuristic ro eight zero however volkswagen took the k
seven zero for its own range spelling the end of nsu as a separate brand the modern era of audi audi quattro audi tt the first audi of the modern era was the audi one zero zero of one nine six eight this was soon joined by the audi eight zero fox which formed the basis
for the one nine seven three volkswagen passat in one nine seven two the audi image at this time was a conservative one and so a proposal from chassis engineer jorg bensinger was accepted to develop the four wheel drive technology in volkswagen s iltis military vehicle for an audi performance car and rally racing car the performance car was named the quattro a turbocharged coup which was also the first production vehicle to feature full time all wheel drive through a
center differential commonly referred to as the ur quattro the ur prefix is a german augmentative used in this case to mean original and is also applied to the first generation of audi s s four and s six sport sedans as in urs four and urs six few of these vehicles were produced all hand built by a single team but the model was a great success
in rallying prominent wins proved the viability of all wheel drive racecars and the audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology in one nine eight six as the passat based audi eight zero was beginning to develop a
kind of grandfather s car image the type eight nine was introduced this completely new development sold extremely well however its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine and its base package was quite spartan even the passenger side mirror was an option in one nine eight seven audi put forward a new and
very elegant audi nine zero which had a much superior set of standard features in the early nineties sales began to slump for the audi eight zero series and some basic construction problems started to surface this decline in sales was not helped in the usa by a six zero minutes report which purported to show that audi automobiles suffered from unintended acceleration the six zero minutes report
was based on customer reports of acceleration when the brake pedal was pushed
independent investigators concluded that this was most likely due to a close placement of the accelerator and brake pedals unlike american cars and the inability when not paying attention to distinguish between the two in race cars when manually downshifting under heavy braking the accelerator has to be used in order to match revs properly so
both pedals have to be close to each other to be operated by the right foot at once toes on the brake heels on the gas us citizens are used to automatic gearboxes and only two well separated pedals this was never an issue in europe as europeans in
general use manual transmission gears and have a feeling for vehicle revs in comparison to the speed of the car six zero minutes ignored this fact and rigged a car to perform in an uncontrolled manner the report immediately crushed audi sales and audi renamed the affected model the five zero
zero zero became the one zero zero two zero zero in one nine eight nine as in germany and elsewhere audi had contemplated withdrawing from the american market until sales began to recover in the mid one nine nine zero s the turning point for audi was the sale of the new a four in one nine nine six and with the release of the a four six eight series which was developed together with vw and other sister brands so called platforms currently audi s sales are growing strongly in europe and the company is renowned for having the
best build quality of any mainstream auto manufacturer two zero zero four marked the one one th straight increase in sales selling seven seven nine four four one vehicles worldwide record figures were recorded from two one out of about five zero major sales markets the largest sales increases came from eastern europe one nine three africa
one seven two and the middle east five eight five in march of two zero zero five audi is building its first two dealerships in india following
its high increase in sales in that region though its brand still doesn t have the global cachet of mercedes benz or bmw audi s reputation for quality and understated style has once again made it a highly desirable marque however after two zero zero three with the release of the new a four and in two zero zero four with the new a six audi s dedication to quality had finally paid off when it started
to receive news reports and various vehicle critics praising audis over mercedes benz and bmw auto racing audi has competed in and sometimes dominated numerous forms of auto racing audi s rich tradition in motorsport began with the auto union in the one nine three zero s in the one nine nine zero
s audi dominated the touring and super touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing stateside rallying in one nine eight zero audi released the quattro an all wheel drive
turbocharged car that went on to win rallies and races worldwide it is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then recently changed rules which allowed the use of all wheel drive in competition racing many critics
doubted the viability of all wheel drive racers thinking them to be too heavy and complex yet the quattro was an instant success winning its first rally on its first outing it won competition after competition for the next two years in
one nine eight four audi launched the sport quattro car which dominated races
in monte carlo and sweden with audi taking all podium finishes but
succumbed to problems further into world rally championship contention after another season mired in mediocre finishes walter r hrl finished the season in his sport quattro s one and helped place audi second in the manufacturer s points audi also received rally honors in the hong kong to beijing rally in that same year mich le mouton the first female wrc driver to win
a championship and a driver for audi took the sport quattro s one now simply called the s one and raced in the
pikes peak hill climb the climb race pits a driver and car to drive up a four three zero two meter high mountain in colorado and in one nine eight five mich le mouton set a new record of one one two five three
nine and being the first woman to set a pikes peak record in one nine eight six audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in portugal involving driver joaquim santos in his rs two zero zero santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side killing three and injuring three zero bobby unser used an audi in that
same year to claim a new record for the pikes peak hill climb at one one zero nine two two motorsports in the usa in one nine eight seven walter r hrl claimed the title for audi setting a new record of one zero four seven eight five in his audi s one he retired from the wrc in two years earlier the audi
s one employed audi s time tested five cylinder turbo charged engine and generated over six zero zero hp four four seven kw the engine was mated
to a six speed gearbox and ran on audi s famous all wheel drive system all of audi s top drivers drove this beast hannu mikkola stig blomqvist walter r hrl and the female driver mich le mouton the audi s one enjoys a zero six zero mph zero one zero zero km h time of two three s this audi s one started the s series of cars for audi which now represents an increased level of sports options and quality to the audi line up as audi moved away from rallying and into circuit
racing they chose first into america with the trans am in one nine eight eight in one nine eight nine audi moved to imsa gto with the nine zero however as they avoided the two major endurance events daytona and sebring despite winning on a regular basis they would lose
out on the title touring cars in one nine nine zero having completed their objective to market
cars in the united states audi returned to europe turning first to
the dtm series with the audi v eight then in one nine nine three being unwilling to build cars for the new formula they turned their attention to the fast growing supertouring series which took place nationally first in the french supertourisme and italian superturismo in the following year audi would switched to the german super tourenwagen known as stw and then to btcc british touring car championship the year after that the fia having difficulty regulating the quattro system and what impact it had on the competitors would eventually ban all four wheel drive cars from competiting in one
nine nine eight by then audi switched all their works efforts to sportscar racing by two zero zero zero audi would still compete in the us with their rs four for the scca speed world gt challenge through dealer team champion racing competing against corvettes vipers and smaller bmws where it is one of the few series to permit four wd cars in two zero zero three champion racing entered an rs six once again the quattro
was superior and champion audi won the championship they returned in two zero zero four to defend their
title but a newcomer cadillac gave them a run for their money after four victories in a row the audis were sanctioned with several
negative changes that deeply affected the car s performance in two zero zero four after years of competiting with the tt r in the revitalised dtm series with privateer team abt racing taking the two zero zero two title with laurent aiello audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported joest racing a four s sports car racing beginning in one nine nine nine audi built
the audi r eight to compete in sports car racing including
the lmp nine zero zero class at the two four hours of le mans the factory supported joest racing team won at le mans three times in a row two zero zero zero two zero zero two as well as winning every
race in the american le mans series in its first year audi also sold the car to customer teams such as champion racing in two zero zero three two bentley speed eight s with engines designed by audi and driven by joest drivers loaned to the fellow vw company competed in the gtp class and finished the race in the top two positions while the champion racing r

more narrow air inlet restrictor cutting power and an additional five zero kg of weight compared to the newer lmp one chassis on average the r eight s were about two three seconds off pace compared to the pescarolo judd but with a team of excellent drivers and experience both champion r eight s were able to take first and third while the oreca team took fourth the champion team
was also the first american team to win le mans since the gulf ford gt s in one nine six seven this also ends the long era of the r eight however its replacement for two zero zero six called the audi r one zero was unveiled on december one three two zero
zero five the r one zero employs many new features including a twin turbocharged diesel engine its first race will likely be the two zero zero six one two hours of sebring as a race test for the two zero zero six two four hours of le mans technology audi is the only car manufacturer that produces one zero zero
galvanized vehicles to prevent corrosion along with other precautionary measures the thus achieved full body zinc coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust and corrosion perforation the body s resulting durability even surpassed
audi s own expectations causing the manufacturer to extend its original one zero year warranty against corrosion perforation to currently one two years an all aluminium car was brought forward by audi and in one nine nine four the audi a eight was launched which introduced aluminium space frame technology audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid nineties and continues to pursue leading edge technology and high performance the all aluminium concept was extended to the company s new sub compact the audi a two which was launched
in two zero zero one in the one nine seven zero s some vehicle manufacturers including audi and subaru designed their own all wheel drive systems in passenger vehicles in the one nine eight zero s all wheel drive systems in cars became a fad and other manufacturers like porsche and mercedes benz offered all wheel drive systems in their cars to compete in the marketplace unfortunately the all wheel drive system in the mercedes benz vehicles
were riddled with problems right from the design sheet the system also was not popular in porsche vehicles because owners wanted the traditional performance of the rear wheel drive they got used to in older porsches although
porsche and mercedes benz offer all wheel drive systems in some cars today neither manufacturer was able to ride the fad and come out on top like audi has today after many decades of class leading technology and engineering the name quattro is an identifiable symbol and trademark that shows would be competitors the level of quality they
have to achieve in order to attempt to compete with audi in the one nine eight zero s audi was the champion of the inline five cylinder two one two two l engine as a longer lasting alternative to more traditional six cylinder engines this engine was used in not only production cars but also their race cars the two one l inline five cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the one nine eight zero s providing well over four zero
zero horsepower two nine eight kw after modification before one nine nine zero there were engines produced with a displacement between two zero l and two three l this range of engine capacity was a good combination of good fuel economy which was on the mind of every motorist in the one nine eight zero s and a
good amount of power the customer wants through the early one nine nine zero s audi began to move more towards the position of being a real competitor in it s target market against mercedes benz and bmw this began with the release of the audi v eight in
one nine nine zero it was essentially a new engine fitted to the audi one zero zero two zero zero but with noticeable bodywork differences most obvious was the new grille that was now incorprated in
the bonnet by one nine nine one audi had the four cylinder audi eight zero the five cylinder audi nine zero and audi one zero zero the turbocharged audi two zero zero and the audi v eight there
was also a coupe version of the eight zero nine zero with both four and five cylinder engines although the five cylinder engine was a successful and very robust powerplant it was still a little too different for the target market with the introduction of an all new audi one zero zero in one nine nine two
audi introduced a two eight l v six engine this engine was also fitted to a face lifted audi eight zero all eight zero and nine zero models were now badged eight zero except for the usa giving this model a choice of four five and six cylinder engines in sedan coupe and cabriolet body styles the five cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice however a turbocharged two three zero bhp one six nine kw version remained the engine initially fitted to the two zero zero quattro two zero v of one
nine nine one was a derivative of the engine fitted to the sport quattro it was fitted to the audi coupe and named the s two and also to the audi one zero zero body and named the s four these two models were the beginning of the mass produced s series of performance cars the audi a eight replaced the
v eight in one nine nine four with a revolutionary aluminium space frame asf to save weight the weight reduction was offset by the quattro all wheel drive
system however it meant the car had similar performance to its rivals but far superior handling the next major model change was in one nine nine five when the audi a four replaced the audi eight zero the new nomenclature scheme was applied to the audi one zero zero to become the audi a six with a minor facelift this also meant the s four became the s six and a new s four was introduced in the a four body the
s two was discontinued the audi cabriolet continued on based on the audi eight zero platform until one nine nine nine gaining the engine upgrades along the way a new a three based on the volkswagen golf was introduced to the range in one nine nine seven and the radical tt coupe and roadster were debuted in one nine nine eight based on the same underpinnings another interesting model introduced was the mercedes benz a class competitor the audi a two the model sold relatively well in europe however audi decided not to develop a new
model and it has since been discontinued as of two zero zero four the engines available throughout the range were now a one four l one
six l and one eight l four cylinder one eight turbo two six l and two eight l v
six two two l turbo charged five cylinder and the four two l v eight the v six s were replaced by new two four and two eight l three zero v v six s in one nine nine eight with marked improvement in power torque and smoothness further engines were added along the way including a three seven l v eight and six zero l w one two for the a eight at the turn of the century audi introduced the direct shift gearbox dsg a manual transmission driveable like an
automatic transmission the system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled clutches instead of a torque converter this is implemented in some volkswagen golf audi a three and tt models the engine range was continually upgraded with a two seven l twin turbo v six being offered in the audi s four a six and allroad the two eight l v six was replaced
by a three zero l unit new models of the a three a four a six and a eight have been introduced with the one eight l engine now two zero l and the three zero l v six is now three one l in size audi has now introduced fsi on some of their engines including the one six l four cylinder a new two zero l audi was the first manufacturer in the world to utilize a turbo charger and fsi on the same powerplant and the three one l v six this is a direct
fuel injection technique that audi had also used on its diesel engines since the early one nine eight zero s as a premium member of the vw group technologies are frequently first introduced to the mass market with audi vehicles before being trickled down to more value oriented brands such as vw seat and koda recent examples of this include dsg and fsi audi now has

an aircraft is any machine capable of atmospheric flight categories and classification aircraft fall into two broad categories heavier than air heavier than air aerodynes including autogyros helicopters and variants and conventional fixed wing aircraft airplanes or aeroplanes fixed wing aircraft generally use an internal combustion engine in the form of a piston engine with a propeller or a turbine engine jet or turboprop to provide thrust that moves the craft forward through the
air the movement of air over the airfoil produces lift that causes the aircraft to fly exceptions are gliders which have no engines and gain their thrust initially from winches or tugs and then from gravity and thermal currents for a glider to maintain its forward speed it must descend in relation to the air but not necessarily in relation to the ground helicopters and autogyros use a spinning rotor a rotary wing to provide lift helicopters also use the rotor to provide thrust the abbreviation vtol is applied to aircraft other than
helicopters that can take off or land vertically stol stands for short take off and landing lighter than air a hot air balloon takes off from royal victoria park bath england lighter than air aerostats hot air balloons and airships aerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same manner as ships float on the water in particular these aircraft use a relatively low density gas such as helium hydrogen or
heated air to displace the air around the craft the distinction between a balloon and an airship is that an airship has some means of controlling both its forward motion and steering itself while balloons are carried along with the wind types of aircraft see also list of aircraft there are several ways to classify aircraft below we describe classifications by design propulsion and usage by design a size

hughes h four spruce goose largest airplane in the world designed by the famous howard hughes a first division by design among aircraft is between lighter than air aerostat and heavier than air aircraft aerodyne examples of lighter than air aircraft include non steerable balloons such as hot air balloons and gas balloons and steerable airships sometimes called dirigible balloons such as blimps that have non rigid construction and rigid airships that have an internal frame the most successful type of rigid
airship was the zeppelin several accidents such as the hindenburg fire at lakehurst nj in one nine three seven led to the demise of large rigid airships in heavier than air aircraft there are two ways to produce lift aerodynamic lift and engine lift in the case of aerodynamic lift the aircraft is kept in the air by wings or rotors see aerodynamics with engine lift the aircraft defeats gravity by use of vertical examples of engine lift aircraft are rockets and vtol aircraft such as the hawker siddeley harrier among aerodynamically lifted
aircraft most fall in the category of fixed wing aircraft where horizontal airfoils produce lift by profiting from airflow patterns determined by bernoulli s equation and to some extent the coanda effect the forerunner of these type of aircraft is the kite kites depend upon the tension between the cord which anchors it to the ground and the force of the wind currents much aerodynamic work was done with kites until test aircraft wind tunnels and now computer modelling programs became available in a conventional configuration the lift surfaces
are placed in front of a control surface or tailplane the other configuration
is the canard where small horizontal control surfaces are placed forward of the wings near the nose of the aircraft canards are becoming more common as supersonic aerodynamics grows more mature and
because the forward surface contributes lift during straight and level flight the number of lift surfaces varied in the pre one nine five zero period as biplanes
two wings and triplanes three wings were numerous in the early days of aviation subsequently most aircraft are monoplanes this is principally an improvement in structures and not aerodynamics other possibilities include the delta wing where lift and horizontal control surfaces are often combined and the flying wing where there is no separate vertical control surface e g the b two spirit a variable geometry swing wing has also been employed in a few examples of combat aircraft the f one one one panavia tornado
f one four tomcat and b one lancer among others the lifting body configuration is where the body itself produce lift so far the only significant practical application of the lifting body is in the space shuttle but many aircraft generate lift from nothing other than wings alone a second category of aerodynamically lifted aircraft are the rotary
wing aircraft here the lift is provided by rotating aerofoils or rotors the best known examples are the helicopter the autogyro and the tiltrotor aircraft such as the v two two osprey some craft have reaction powered rotors with gas jets at the tips but most have one or more lift rotors powered from engine driven shafts a further category might encompass the wing in ground effect types for example the russian ekranoplan also nicknamed the caspian sea monster and hovercraft most of the latter employing a skirt and achieving limited ground or water clearance to reduce friction and
achieve speeds above those achieved by boats of similar weight a recent innovation is a completely new class of aircraft the fan wing this uses a fixed wing with a forced airflow produced by cylindrical fans mounted above it is two zero zero five in development in the united kingdom and finally the flapping wing ornithopter is a category of its own these designs may have potential but are not yet practical by propulsion a turboprop engined dehavilland twin otter adapted as a floatplane some types of aircraft such as the balloon or glider do not have any
propulsion balloons drift with the wind though normally the pilot can control
the altitude either by heating the air or by releasing ballast giving some directional control since the wind direction changes with altitude for gliders takeoff takes place from a high location or the aircraft is pulled into the air
by a ground based winch or vehicle or towed aloft by a powered tug aircraft airships combine a balloon s buoyancy with some kind of propulsion usually propeller driven until world war ii the internal combustion piston engine was virtually the only type of propulsion used for powered aircraft see also aircraft engine the piston engine is still used in the majority of aircraft produced since it is efficient at the lower altitudes used by small aircraft but the radial engine with the cylinders
arranged in a circle around the crankshaft has largely given way to the horizontally opposed engine with the cylinders lined up on two sides of the crankshaft water cooled v engines as used in automobiles were common in high speed aircraft until they were replaced by jet and turbine power piston engines typically operate using avgas or regular gasoline though some new ones are being designed to operate on diesel or jet fuel piston engines normally become less efficient above seven zero zero zero eight zero zero zero ft two one zero zero
two four zero zero m above sea level because there is less oxygen available for combustion to solve
that problem some piston engines have mechanically powered compressors blowers or turbine powered turbochargers or turbonormalizers that compress the air before feeding it into the engine these piston engines can often operate efficiently at two zero zero zero zero ft six one
zero zero m above sea level or higher altitudes that require the use of supplemental oxygen or cabin pressurisation during the forties and especially following the one nine seven three energy crisis development work was done on propellers with swept tips or even scimitar shaped blades for use in
high speed commercial and military transports pressurised aircraft however are more likely to use the turbine
engine since it is naturally efficient at higher altitudes and can operate above four zero zero zero zero ft helicopters also typically use turbine engines in addition to turbine engines like the turboprop and turbojet other types of high altitude high performance engines have included the ramjet and the pulse jet rocket aircraft have occasionally been experimented with they are restricted
to rather specialised niches such as spaceflight where no oxygen is available for combustion rockets carry their own oxygen by usage the major distinction in aircraft usage is between military aviation which includes all uses of aircraft
for military purposes such as combat patrolling search and rescue reconnaissance transport and training and civil aviation which includes all uses of aircraft for non military purposes military aircraft a prototype of hindustan aeronautics light combat aircraft combat aircraft like fighters or bombers represent only a minority of the category many civil aircraft have been produced in separate models for military use such as the civil douglas dc three airliner which
became the military c four seven c five three r four d transport in the u s military and the dakota in the u k and the commonwealth even the small fabric covered two seater piper j three cub had a military version the l four liaison observation and trainer aircraft in the past gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft for example balloons were used for observation during the
american civil war and world war i and cargo gliders were used during
world war ii to land intruding german troops in a few european countries in the one nine four zero four two period while allied troops used them in landings on sicily and italy one nine four three and in western europe france and holland on d day the normandy six june one nine four four operation overlord invasion and in operation anvil dragoon one nine four four and in operation market garden one nine four four combat aircraft themselves though used a handful of times for reconnaissance
and surveillance during the italo turkish war did not come into widespread use until the balkan war when first air dropped bomb was invented and widely used by bulgarian air force against turkey during world war i many types of aircraft were adapted for attacking the ground or enemy vehicles ships guns aircraft and the first aircraft designed as
bombers were born in order to prevent the enemy from bombing fighter aircraft were developed to intercept and shoot down enemy aircraft tankers were developed after world war ii to refuel other aircraft in mid air thus increasing their operational range by the time of the vietnam war helicopters had come into widespread military use especially for transporting supplying and supporting ground troops civil aviation bell two zero six b jetranger iii helicopter civil aviation includes both scheduled airline
flights and general aviation a catch all covering other kinds of private and commercial use the vast majority of flights flown around the world each day belong to the general aviation category ranging from recreational balloon flying to civilian flight training to business trips to firefighting to medevac flights
to cargo transportation on freight aircraft within general aviation the major distinction is
between private flights where the pilot is not paid for time or
expenses and commercial flights where the pilot is paid by a customer or employer private pilots use aircraft primarily for personal travel business travel or recreation usually these private pilots own their own aircraft and take out loans from banks or specialized lenders to purchase them commercial general aviation pilots use aircraft
for a wide range of tasks such as flight training pipeline surveying passenger and freight transport policing crop dusting and medical transport medevac piston powered propeller aircraft single engine or twin engine are especially common for both private
and commercial general aviation but even private pilots occasionally own and operate helicopters like the bell jetranger or turboprops like the beechcraft king air business jets are typically flown

music artist credited with pushing forward the genres of techno ambient acid and drum and bass he has been described as the
most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music biography richard david james was born to welsh parents lorna and derek james in one nine seven one in limerick ireland james spent his childhood in cornwall united kingdom as a teenager he became a dj and musician on the local rave scene taking on the moniker aphex twin james formed the rephlex records label in one nine nine one with his friend grant
wilson claridge and released his first records on this label as well as mighty force and r come to daddy and windowlicker which were shown on mtv and the covers of music magazines including nme the aphex twin logo present on most aphex twin afx releases in two zero zero one aphex twin released his most personal
album yet drukqs a two cd album which featured prepared piano songs under the influence of erik satie
and john cage also included were abrasive fast and meticulously programmed computer made songs the level of detail and artistry was so high that reviewers and fans complained that the music was less in the style of innovative pop music and more about detailed beautiful and personal musical art drukqs is perhaps richard s most controversial album to date the album lacked the novelty found in his other albums so reviewers guessed this album was released as a contract breaker with warp records a credible guess
as james next big release came out on his own rephlex label it is also rumored that the album drukqs was released as it was because he had almost all of these songs on a creative jukebox that he forgot and left on a plane and in fear of all of the tracks being leaked to the internet its release was rushed as to avoid this in late two zero zero four rumours of james return to a more acid techno based sound were realised with the analord series for these records
james used his extensive collection of roland drum machines which he bought when they were still at bargain prices also he used one of the rarest and most desirable synthesizers of his generation
the synton fenix and the notoriously difficult to program roland mc four sequencer a sequencer with a reputation for excellent timing as well as
the infamous roland tb three zero three for his trademark acid melodies apart from music richard d james is a talented photographer having done his own artwork direction for many of his albums on the windowlicker single james hid a picture of his face created most likely with metasynth
in the second track commonly referred to as formula symbol
or equation which can be seen in a spectral analysis of the track the picture illustrates his famous toothy evil grin aphex twin s influences
james has stated in numerous interviews that he has no musical influences other than himself he claims to have listened rarely to songs on the radio as a child and that he is unable to read sheet music conversely james has said that he has listened to many bands and artists for inspiration and sampling notably pink floyd and led zeppelin for their breaks used as break beats but he has also expressed appreciation for the fall he signed fellow musicans
and personal friends tom squarepusher jenkinson and mike paradinas ziq to his rephlex record label as well as luke vibert other debated influences include eight zero eight state for whom he has done remix work john cage and his prepared piano technique itself inspired by henry cowell and erik satie independently in the piano pieces on drukqs coil tod dockstader an electronic musician who worked with tape mangling sounds into music of the frequency and dynamics spectrum mike dred acid techno pioneer and techno electroacoustic hybrid pioneer together
with peter green on dred s machine codes label james is quoted as saying that he listened to dred amnesia kraftwerk and their electropop styles kevin master reese saunderson
derrick may techno pioneer joe meek especially i heard a new world album of this pioneering one nine six zero s uk producer erik satie whose melodic style was borrowed on drukqs squarepusher and luke vibert for their extreme versions of drum and bass influence of aphex twin on others fans and journalists coined the genre names idm
and drill and bass to describe aphex twin s novel approach to dance music richard s own rephlex records label which he co owns with grant wilson claridge prefers
the term braindance these labels have proven useful for upcoming artists looking to find a genre name for their own music influenced by aphex twin and warp records in aphex twin s words on the intelligent dance music label i just think it s really funny to have terms like that it s basically saying this is intelligent and everything else is stupid it s really nasty to everyone else s music laughs it makes me laugh things like that i don t use
names i just say that i like something or i don t aphex twin tends to distance himself from rock pop music yet he has still had an influence on the rock bands like radiohead nine inch nails and peace burial at sea aphex twin dismissed going on tour with radiohead i wouldn t play with them since i
don t like them aphex twin s press aphex twin press

his enormous fortune to institute the nobel prizes the synthetic element nobelium was named after him personal background alfred nobel a descendant of the one seven th century scientist olaus rudbeck one six three zero one seven zero two was the third son of immanuel nobel one eight zero one one eight seven two born in stockholm he went with his family at an early age to st petersburg where his father who had invented modern plywood started
a torpedo works in one eight five nine this was left to the care of the second son ludvig emmanuel one eight three one one eight eight eight by whom it was greatly
enlarged and alfred returning to sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business devoted himself to the study of explosives and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerine discovered in one eight four seven by ascanio sobrero one of his fellow students under th ophile jules pelouze at the university of torino several explosions were reported at
their family owned factory in heleneborg and a disastrous one in one eight six four killed alfred s
younger brother emil and several other workers less well known is that alfred nobel was also a playwright his only play nemesis a prose tragedy in four acts about beatrice cenci partly inspired by percy bysshe shelley s blank verse tragedy in five acts the cenci was printed when he was dying and the whole stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous the first surviving edition bilingual swedish esperanto was published in sweden in two zero zero three the play has not yet may two zero zero three
been translated into any language other than esperanto alfred nobel is buried in the norra begravningsplatsen in
stockholm dynamite nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr diatomaceous earth
it became safer and more convenient to manipulate and this mixture he patented in one eight six seven as dynamite he next combined nitroglycerin with another high explosive gun cotton and obtained a transparent jelly like substance which was a still more powerful explosive than dynamite blasting gelatin as it was called was patented in one eight seven six and was followed by a host of similar combinations modified by the addition
of potassium nitrate wood pulp and various other substances some years later nobel produced ballistite one of the earliest of the nitroglycerin smokeless gunpowders containing in its latest forms about equal parts of gun cotton and nitroglycerin this powder was a precursor of cordite and nobel s claim that his patent covered the latter was the occasion of vigorously contested law suits between him and the british government in one eight nine four and one eight nine five cordite also consists of nitroglycerin and gun cotton but
the form of the latter which its inventors wished to use was the most highly nitrated variety which is not soluble in mixtures of ether and alcohol whereas nobel contemplated using a less nitrated form which is soluble in such mixtures the question was complicated by the fact that it is in practice impossible to prepare either of these two forms without admixture of the other eventually the courts decided against nobel cordite became
a mainstay munition of the british empire throughout the late one nine th and early two zero th century from the manufacture of dynamite and other explosives and from the exploitation of the baku oil fields in the development of which he and his brothers ludvig and robert hjalmar one eight two nine one eight nine six took a leading part he amassed an immense fortune armaments manufacturer a less well remembered aspect of his
life was his role in setting up a major armaments manufacturer bofors defence ab he was bofors most famous owner
and owned the company from one eight nine four until his death in december
of one eight nine six he had the key role in reshaping this iron manufacturer to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry bofors went on to become a major supplier of howitzers cannons and field guns to armies around the world including the usa and many third world dictatorships the prizes the erroneous publication in one eight eight eight of a premature obituary of nobel by a french newspaper condemning his invention of dynamite is said to have
made him decide to leave a better legacy to the world after his death on november two seven one eight nine five at the swedish norwegian club
in paris nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the nobel prizes to be awarded annually without distinction
of nationality he died of a stroke on december one zero one eight nine six at san remo italy the amount set aside for the nobel prize foundation was three one million kronor the first three of these prizes are for eminence in physical science in chemistry and in medical science or physiology the fourth is for the most remarkable literary work in an ideal direction and the fifth is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international brother
sisterhood in the suppression or reduction of standing armies or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses the formulation about the literary prize in an ideal direction swedish i idealisk riktning is cryptic and has caused much consternation for many years the swedish academy interpreted ideal as idealistic in swedish idealistisk and used it as a pretext to not give the prize to important but less romantic authors such as henrik ibsen august strindberg and leo tolstoy this interpretation has been revised and the prize given to for example dario fo and jos saramago who definitely do
not belong to the camp of literary idealism when reading nemesis in its original swedish and looking at his own philosophical and literary standpoint it seems possible that his intention might have been rather the opposite of that first believed that the prize should be given to
authors who fight for their ideals against such authorities as god church and
state there was also quite a lot of room for interpretation by the
bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes given that he had not consulted them before making the
will in his one page testament he stipulated that the money should go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry he had opened the door to technological awards but he had not left instructions on how to do the split between science and technology since the deciding bodies he had chosen in
these domains were more concerned with science than technology it is not surprising that the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers technicians
or other inventors in a sense the technological prizes announced recently by the world technology network are an indirect and thus not funded by the nobel foundation continuation of the wishes of nobel as he set them out in his testament in two zero zero one his great grandnephew peter asked the bank of sweden to differentiate its award to economists given in alfred nobel s memory from the five other awards this has caused much controversy whether the prize for
economics is actually a nobel prize see bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel nobel prize rumors there is no nobel prize for mathematics a common legend states that nobel decided
against a prize in mathematics because a woman he proposed to or his wife or his mistress rejected him or cheated on him with a famous mathematician often claimed to be g sta mittag leffler there is no historical evidence to support the story and nobel was never married references one nine one one encyclop dia britannica

and inventor today he is still widely considered to be the inventor of the telephone although this matter has become controversial with a number of people claiming that antonio meucci was the real inventor and others holding out for elisha gray the founder of the western electric manufacturing company in addition to his work in telecommunications technology he was responsible for important advances in aviation and hydrofoil technology biography born alexander bell in
edinburgh he later adopted the middle name graham out of admiration for alexander graham a family friend many called him the father of the deaf this title is somewhat
ironic due to his belief in the practice of eugenics he hoped to one day eradicate deafness from the population his family was associated with the teaching of elocution his grandfather in london his uncle in dublin and his father alexander melville bell in edinburgh were
all professed elocutionists the latter has published a variety of works on the subject several of which are
well known especially his treatise on visible speech which appeared in edinburgh in one eight six eight in this he explains his method of instructing deaf mutes by means of their
eyesight how to articulate words and also how to read what other persons are saying by the motions of their lips alexander graham bell was educated at the royal high school of edinburgh from which he graduated at the age of one three at the age of one six he secured a position as a pupil teacher of elocution and music in weston house academy at elgin moray scotland the next year he spent at the university of edinburgh he was graduated from university college london from one
eight six six to one eight six seven he was an instructor at somersetshire college at bath somerset england while still in scotland he is said to have turned his attention to the science of acoustics with
a view to ameliorate the deafness of his mother in one eight seven zero at the age of two three he emigrated with his family to canada where they settled at brantford before he left scotland bell had turned his attention to telephony and in canada he continued an interest in communication machines he designed a piano which could transmit its music to a distance by means of electricity in one eight seven three he accompanied his father to montreal canada where he was employed in teaching the system of
visible speech the elder bell was invited to introduce the system into a large day school for mutes at boston but he
declined the post in favor of his son who became professor of vocal physiology and elocution at boston university s school of oratory bell speaking into prototype model of the telephone at boston university he continued his research in the same field and endeavored to produce a telephone which would not only send musical
notes but articulate speech with financing from his american father in law on march seven one eight seven six the u s patent office granted him patent number one seven four four six five covering the method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by causing electrical undulations similar in form to
the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound the telephone after obtaining the patent for the telephone bell continued his
many experiments in communication which culminated in the invention of the photophone transmission of sound on a beam of light a precursor of today s optical fiber systems he also worked in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf the range of bell s inventive genius is represented only in part by the eighteen patents granted in his name alone and the twelve he shared with his collaborators these included fourteen for the telephone and telegraph four
for the photophone one for the phonograph five for aerial vehicles four for hydroairplanes and two for a selenium cell bell had many great ideas that are now
real inventions during his volta laboratory period bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound although the trio
briefly experimented with the concept they were unable to develop a workable prototype they abandoned the idea never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder the computer and the cd rom bell s own home used a primitive form of air conditioning in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice he also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution methane gas he reasoned could be produced from the waste of farms and factories at his canadian estate in beinn bhreagh nova scotia
he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere in a magazine interview published shortly before his death he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses in one eight eight two he became a naturalized citizen
of the united states in one eight eight eight he was one of the founding members of the national geographic society and became its second president he was the recipient of many honors the french government conferred on him the decoration of the l gion d honneur
legion of honor the acad mie fran aise bestowed on him the volta prize of five zero zero zero zero francs the royal society of arts in london awarded him the albert medal in one nine zero two
and the university of w rzburg bavaria granted him a ph d he was
awarded the aiee s edison medal in one nine one four for for meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone bell married mabel hubbard who was one of his pupils at boston university as well as a deaf mute on july one one one eight seven seven his invention of the telephone was actually a
device he was trying to create that would allow him to
communicate with his wife and his deaf mother he died at beinn bhreagh located on nova
scotia s cape breton island near the village of baddeck in one nine two two and is buried alongside his wife atop beinn bhreagh mountain overlooking bras d or lake he was survived by two of their four children bell was listed among the one zero zero greatest britons the one zero zero
greatest americans and in the top ten greatest canadians the only person to be on more than one list bell and decibel the bel b is a unit of measurement invented by bell labs and named after bell the bel was too large for everyday use so the decibel db equal to zero one b became more commonly used the db is commonly
used as a unit for measuring sound intensity the photophone another of bell s inventions was the photophone a device enabling the transmission of sound over a beam of light which he developed together with charles sumner tainter the device employed light sensitive cells of crystalline selenium which has the property that its electrical resistance varies inversely with the illumination i e the resistance is higher when the material is in the dark and lower when it is
lighted the basic principle was to modulate a beam of light directed at a receiver made of crystalline selenium to which a telephone was
attached the modulation was done either by means of a vibrating mirror or a rotating disk periodically obscuring the light beam this idea was by no means new selenium had been discovered by j ns jakob berzelius in one eight one seven and the peculiar properties of crystalline or granulate selenium were discovered by willoughby smith in one eight seven three in one eight seven eight one writer with the initials j f
w from kew described such an arrangement in nature in a column appearing on june one three asking the readers whether any experiments in that direction had already been done in his paper on the photophone bell credited one a c browne
of london with the independent discovery in one eight seven eight the same year bell became aware of the idea bell and tainter however were apparently the first to perform a successful experiment by no means any easy task as they even had to produce the selenium cells with the desired resistance characteristics themselves in one experiment in washington d c the sender and the receiver were placed on different buildings some seven zero zero feet two
one three metres apart the sender consisted of a mirror directing sunlight onto the mouthpiece where the light beam was modulated by a vibrating mirror focused by a lens and
directed at the receiver which was simply a parabolic reflector with the selenium cells in the focus and the telephone attached with this setup bell and tainter succeeded to communicate clearly the photophone was patented on december one eight one eight eight zero but the quality of communication remained poor and the research was not pursued by bell metal detector bell is also credited with the
invention of the metal detector in one eight eight one the device was hurriedly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of u s president james garfield the metal detector worked but didn t find the bullet because the metal bedframe the president was lying on confused the instrument bell gave
a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the american association for the advancement of science in august one eight eight two though unsuccessful in its first incarnation this achievement would eventually change the nature of physical security experimental aircraft bell was also interested in aircraft and was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the aerial experiment association the association was officially formed at baddeck nova scotia in october one nine zero seven at the suggestion of mrs mabel bell and with her financial support it was headed by the inventor himself
the founding members were four young men american glenn h curtiss a motorcycle manufacturer who would later be awarded the scientific american trophy for the first official one kilometre flight in the western hemisphere and later be world renowned as an airplane manufacturer frederick w casey baldwin the first canadian and first british subject to pilot a public flight in hammondsport new york j a d mccurdy and lieutenant thomas selfridge an official
observer of the u s government one of the project s inventions the aileron is a standard component of aircraft today note that the aileron was also invented independently by robert esnault pelterie in one nine zero nine bell s silver dart made the
first controlled powered flight in canada however a series of canadian flights failed to interest the canadian military in developing the airplane the hydrofoil the march one nine zero six scientific american article by american
hydrofoil pioneer william e meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat bell and casey baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of one nine zero eight as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water baldwin studied the work of the italian inventor enrico forlanini and began testing models this led him and bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft during his world tour of
one nine one zero one nine one one bell and baldwin met with forlanini in italy they had rides in the forlanini hydrofoil boat over lake maggiore baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying on returning to baddeck a number of designs were tried culminating in the hd four using renault engines a top speed of
five four miles per hour was achieved with rapid acceleration good stability and steering and the ability to take waves
without difficulty bell s report to the navy permitted him to obtain two three five zero horsepower two six zero kw engines in july one nine one nine on september nine one nine one nine the hd four set a world s marine speed record of seven zero eight six miles per hour this record stood for ten years eugenics along with many very prominent thinkers and scientists of the time bell was connected
with the eugenics movement in the united states from one nine one two until one nine one eight he was the chairman of the board
of scientific advisors to the eugenics record office associated with cold spring harbor laboratory in new york and regularly attended meetings in one nine two one he was the honorary president of the second international congress of eugenics held under the auspices of the american museum of natural history in new york organizations such as these advocated passing laws with success in some states that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be as bell called them a defective variety of the human race much of his thoughts

sung in the irish language a translation of the original it is also known by the english language title a soldier s song as well as the national anthem of ireland amhr n n isi nta na h ireann the lyrics of the song are by peadar kearney and the music by both kearney and patrick heeney it was composed in one nine zero seven
and was first published in irish freedom in one nine one two the irish language version of the original was the work of bulmer hobson the song is regarded by many nationalists as the national anthem of the whole of ireland and it is
therefore sung for example at gaelic athletic association matches held anywhere on the island unionists however reject
this use of amhr n na bhfiann and at international games played by the all ireland irish rugby football union team the song ireland s call is sung instead of or in the republic of ireland as well as amhr n na bhfiann history amhr n na bhfiann was relatively unknown until it was sung by rebels in the general post office gpo during the easter rising of one nine one six and afterwards in british internment camps the song became
the official state anthem in one nine two six when it replaced the unofficial anthem god save ireland god save the king was the official anthem
of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland until the independent irish free state was established in one nine two two the continued use of god save the king by some irish people caused embarrassment to the new irish state and on
one famous occasion governor general james mcneill refused to attend a public function in trinity college when he discovered that the university intended playing the anthem during his visit even after the adoption of amhr n na bhfiann as the official anthem of the irish free state in july one nine two six a minority continued to sing the british anthem and to pray for the king and queen in religious ceremonies for a number of years in one nine three four the irish state acquired the copyright of the song for the sum of one
two zero zero controversy also surrounds the change in the wording of amhr n na bhfiann over the years in the original translation the first line read as sinne laochra gaedheal literally we the heroes of ireland this has since been replaced by sinne fianna f il which to some people is evidence that the anthem has been hijacked by the fianna f il party in recent years a number of irish newspapers and columnists
have proposed replacing amhr n na bhfiann with a new national anthem arguing that the current wording is excessively militant and anti british others have argued that the melody is difficult for bands to
play problems have sometimes been witnessed at international sporting events where either the entire song not just the chorus that constitutes the anthem has been played as occurred for example at the los angeles olympics or the right part has been played but at the wrong speed as occurred at the sydney olympics in two zero zero zero some have proposed that the anthem be replaced with the irish rugby football union s song ireland s call the suggestion has also been
made that as occurred in germany after world war ii the government might change the words of the
anthem while keeping the original melody lyrics the irish national anthem consists of the chorus only of amhr n na bhfiann
and is almost always sung in irish the first two lines of the anthem and the last two played together form the irish presidential salute which is played
when the president of ireland attends official events the chorus of amhr n na bhfiann as used for the anthem is given below irish version sinne fianna f il at faoi gheall ag irinn bu on d r slua thar toinn do r inig chughainn faoi mh id bheith saor sean t r r sinsear feasta n fh gfar faoin tior n n faoin tr ill anocht a

languages of uncertain affiliation in fact given the antiquity of the indo european hittite and luwian languages some scholars have proposed anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the indo european languages have radiated other authors have proposed an anatolian origin for the etruscans of ancient italy today the inhabitants of anatolia are mostly native speakers of the turkish language which was introduced with the conquest of anatolia by turkic peoples and the rise of the seljuk empire in the one one th century however anatolia remained multi ethnic until

gui the lisa in one nine eight four apple introduced the revolutionary macintosh the macintosh commonly called the mac was the first successful commercial implementation of a gui which is now used in all major computers apple is known for its innovative well designed hardware and software such as the ipod and
the imac as well as the well known itunes application part of the ilife suite and mac os x its current operating system history one nine seven six to one nine eight zero the founding of apple apple computer was
founded in los gatos california on april one one nine seven six by steve jobs steve wozniak and
ronald wayne to sell the apple i personal computer kit at six six six six six they were hand built in jobs parents garage and the apple i was first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club jobs and wozniak the two steves had been friends since one nine seven one jobs managed to interest wozniak in assembling
a personal computer and selling it jobs approached a local computer store the byte shop who after jobs famous persuasion ordered fifty units and paid five zero zero for each unit jobs then ordered components from cramer electronics a national electronic parts distributor using a variety of methods including borrowing space from friends and family and selling various items including a volkswagen type two bus jobs managed to secure the parts needed while wozniak and another friend ronald wayne assembled the apple i they were delivered in june
and paid for on delivery eventually two zero zero apple i computers were built note that the original apple i was actually a motherboard it was not a full computer as we know it today the apple ii was introduced on april one six one nine seven seven at the first west coast computer faire it was
popular with home users and was occasionally sold to business users particularly after the release of the first spreadsheet for any computer called visicalc see the timeline for dates of apple ii family model releases the one nine seven seven apple ii and its younger siblings the ii plus iie iic and iigs but it was a mild success for the small computer company by now
jobs and his partners had a staff of computer designers and a production line the apple ii was succeeded by the apple iii in may one nine eight zero as the company struggled to compete against ibm and microsoft in the lucrative business and corporate computing market the designers of the apple iii were forced to comply with jobs request to omit the cooling fan and this ultimately resulted in thousands
of recalled units due to overheating an updated version was introduced in one nine eight three but it was also a failure due to bad press and discouraged buyers nevertheless the principals of the company persevered with further innovations and marketing jobs and several other apple employees including jef raskin visited xerox parc in december one nine seven nine to see the alto computer xerox granted apple engineers three days of
access to the parc facilities in return for selling them one million dollars in pre ipo apple stock approximately one eight million net one nine eight one to one nine eight nine lisa and macintosh the protagonist
of apple s well known one nine eight four ad set in a dystopian future modeled after the orwellian novel nineteen eighty four in the early one nine eight zero s ibm and microsoft continued to gain market share at apple s expense in the personal computer industry using a fundamentally different business model ibm marketed an open hardware
standard created with the ibm pc which was bundled with microsoft s ms dos microsoft disk operating system in one nine eight three apple introduced the first personal computer to be sold to the public with a graphical user interface gui named the lisa using a gui the user communicates
with the computer by interacting with icons onscreen that resemble real world items folders documents images however the lisa was a commercial failure as a result of its high price tag
nine nine nine five and limited software titles after the lisa apple began work on a similar but less expensive computer to be called the macintosh it was launched in one nine eight four with the now famous super bowl advertisement based on george
orwell s novel one nine eight four it was an immediate success particularly in the world of graphic and communications design where its gui which was to become the industry standard and ability to handle large graphic files surpassed anything else on the market the macintosh also spawned the concept of mac evangelism among users which was pioneered by apple employee and later apple fellow guy kawasaki in anticipation of the macintosh launch bill gates co founder and chairman of microsoft was given several macintosh prototypes in one nine eight three to develop software for the
mac in one nine eight five microsoft launched microsoft windows with its own gui for ibm pcs using many of the elements of the macintosh os an internal power struggle developed between jobs and new ceo john sculley in one nine eight five apple s board of directors sided with sculley and jobs was asked to resign from the company jobs then founded next inc a computer company that built machines with futuristic designs and ran the unix derived nextstep operating system although
powerful next computers never caught on with buyers due in part to their high purchase price one nine nine zero to one nine nine three powerbook and decline having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky macintosh portable in one nine eight nine apple turned to industrial designers and adopted a product strategy based in three portable devices one portable was built by sony which had a strong reputation for designing small durable
and functional electronics devices sony took the specs of the mac portable put in a smaller two hour battery a much smaller physically twenty megabyte hard drive and a smaller nine inch passive matrix screen called the powerbook one zero zero this landmark product was introduced in one nine nine one and established the modern form and ergonomic layout of the laptop computer this solidified apple s reputation as a quality manufacturer both of desktop and now portable machines the success of the powerbook and several other apple products during this period led to increasing revenue the magazine macaddict named
the period between one nine eight nine to one nine nine one the first golden age of the macintosh this golden age was not to last the introduction of microsoft windows presented an interface that many
people thought was close enough to the macintosh in terms of ease
of use and overall look and feel apple thought that windows was too close and sued microsoft for theft of intellectual property at about the same time apple
branched out into consumer electronics one example of this product diversification was the apple quicktake digital camera which never caught on a more famous example was the newton an early pda that was introduced in one nine nine three though it failed commercially it defined and launched the new category of computing and was a forerunner and inspiration of devices such as blackberry palm pilot and its descendants pocketpcs during the one nine nine zero s apple greatly expanded its computer lineup as well it offered a multitude of different models yet it failed to adequately
explain to the public why it should choose one model over another the costs involved in making such a wide variety of products coupled with some highly publicized product recalls and the growing popularity of microsoft windows all lead to the near bankruptcy of apple in the mid to late one nine nine zero s one nine nine four to one nine nine seven attempts at reinvention by the mid one nine nine zero s apple realized that it had to reinvent the macintosh in order
to stay competitive in the computer world the needs of both computer users and computer programs were becoming for a variety of technical reasons harder for the existing hardware and operating system to address in one nine nine four apple surprised its loyalists by allying with its long time competitor ibm and motorola in the so called aim alliance this was a bid to create a new computing platform the powerpc reference platform or prep which would use
ibm and motorola hardware coupled with apple s software the aim alliance hoped that prep s performance and
apple s software would leave the pc far behind thus countering microsoft which had become apple s chief competitor towards this end apple tried to recruit other
companies that would build prep compliant computers apple hoped to expand the mac os market share by licensing the operating system to these other companies like microsoft had promoted dos and windows by licensing them to external manufacturers only a few companies notably power computing and umax agreed to produce these computers but eventually the licensing program was suspended as the first step toward launching the prep platform apple started the power macintosh line in
one nine nine four using ibm s powerpc processor this processor utilized a risc architecture which differed substantially from the motorola six eight k series that had been used by all previous macs apple s os s were rewritten so that most software for the older macs could run on the powerpc series in emulation also throughout the mid to late one nine nine zero s apple tried to improve its operating system s multitasking and memory management after first attempting to modify its existing code
apple realized that it would be better to start with an entirely new operating system and then modify it to fit the macintosh interface apple did some preliminary work with ibm towards this goal with the taligent project but that project never produced a replacement operating system they then investigated using be s beos next s nextstep os and also microsoft s windows nt os nextstep was chosen and this supplied the platform for the modern os x on february four one nine nine seven apple completed its purchase of next and its nextstep operating system thus bringing steve jobs
back into apple on july nine one nine nine seven gil amelio was ousted as ceo of apple by the board of directors after overseeing a one two year record low stock price and crippling financial losses despite an outstanding decade of innovation jobs stepped in as the interim ceo and began a critical restructuring of the company s product line one nine nine eight to two zero zero five new beginnings steve jobs introducing the original imac computer in one nine nine eight in one nine nine eight a year after jobs had returned to the
company apple introduced a new all in one macintosh echoing the original macintosh one two eight k the imac a new design that eliminated most apple standard connections
like scsi and adb in favor of two usb ports while technically not impressive it was aimed
at a general market it featured an innovative new design its translucent plastic case originally bondi blue and white and later many other colors is considered an industrial design hallmark of the late nine zero s the imac design team was led by jonathan ive who later also designed the ipod the imac proved to be phenomenally successful with eight zero zero zero zero zero units sold in one nine nine eight making the company a profit that year of three zero nine million apple s first profitable year since michael spindler

as has been done to computerized images the original apple logo was designed by steve jobs and ron wayne and depicts isaac newton sitting under an apple tree however this design was soon to be replaced by the now famous rainbow apple with a bite taken out of it it was one of a set of designs rob janoff presented jobs in one nine seven six in the book zeroes and ones author sadie plant speculates that the rainbow apple logo was a
homage to alan turing the homosexual father of modern computer science who committed suicide by eating a cyanide laced apple in imitation of the movie snow white and the seven dwarfs this seems to be an urban legend as the apple logo was designed two years before gilbert baker s rainbow pride flag and did not follow the same color pattern in one nine nine eight the logo became single colored though no specific color is prescribed for example it is grey on the
power mac g five and apple imac blue by default in mac os x chrome on the about this mac panel and the boot screen in os x one

the two eras of steve jobs tenure some even regard the company as a cult or at least having cult like features jobs charisma infamously referred to as his reality distortion field has drawn criticism from a technical standpoint apple was also criticized for having a closed and proprietary architecture with the original macintosh and refusing to adopt open standards
for many years a not invented here nih culture seemed to prevail the itunes music store continues this trend utilizing a proprietary digital rights management system called fairplay that requires burning and re ripping a cd to place purchased songs on any digital audio player besides the ipod that trend was largely reversed with mac os x and the company now has an official policy of adopting relevant open industry standards mac os x is based on
a free software open source software kernel and core operating system called darwin apple also uses an open source framework called webkit in its safari web browser apple has used industry standard hardware technologies for many years many apple technologies have also become industry standards where no former standard existed for example bonjour zero configuration networking and firewire some non apple technologies only gained
wide industry acceptance after apple adopted them including three five inch floppy disks scsi the universal serial bus usb wi fi and of course graphical user interfaces guis apple has recently adopted an intel

advocates are often critical of apple s attempt to appeal to their particular movements such advocates claim that such a marketing scheme is not taken seriously enough by apple because
mac os x has many proprietary technologies in essential areas other open source advocates make a counter argument that apple has done much more for open source software than many other major commercial software developers by releasing large portions of source code to the public through the apple
public source license apsl some third party developers are also critical of the competing factions within apple itself noting an apparent
rivalry between the developers of cocoa which came from next and those of carbon which came from apple this rivalry is seen as counterproductive and unnecessary by many developers apple s retail initiative has had a mixed reception despite its success promoting the apple brand retailers have suggested that apple owned retail stores receive preference when receiving apple hardware obtaining limited stock product earlier and at lower prices this accusation is denied by

one two march one nine three eight the anschluss german connection or political union also known as the anschluss sterreichs was the one nine three eight inclusion of austria into greater germany by the nazi regime the events of march one two one nine three eight were the first major steps in adolf hitler s long desired expansion of germany the anschluss followed the return to germany of the saar region which had been under the control of the league of nations for one five years by the terms
of the treaty of versailles it was followed by the inclusion of the sudetenland later in one nine three eight the invasion of the remainder of czechoslovakia in one nine three nine and the invasion of poland the anschluss was preceded by a period of growing political pressure on austria exerted by germany demanding recognition of the outlawed austrian national socialist
party and later their share of government in one nine three eight austrian chancellor kurt schuschnigg in a last bid to retain austrian independence announced a referendum to determine independence or union with germany germany then pressured schuschnigg into handing over power to the nazi party this well planned internal overthrow by the austrian nazi party of austria s state institutions in vienna on march one one meant that when wehrmacht
troops entered into austria to enforce the anschluss no fighting ever took place the international response to the anschluss was mild the world war i allies only lodged diplomatic protests and no concrete action was taken to reverse the anschluss even though the allies were on paper committed to upholding the terms of the treaty of versailles which specifically prohibited the union of austria and germany
austria ceased to exist as an independent nation until a preliminary austrian government was finally reinstated on april two seven one nine four five and was legally recognized by the allies in the following months situation before the anschluss the dissolution of austria hungary main articles german empire and austrofascism the idea of grouping all german people into one state had been the subject of inconclusive debate since the end of the holy roman empire
in one eight zero six prior to one eight six six
it was generally thought that the unification of the german peoples could only succeed under austrian leadership grossdeutschland but
the loss of the austro prussian war by austria allowed otto von bismarck to establish the prussian dominated german empire in one eight seven one without the german speaking parts of austria hungary kleindeutschland when
the latter broke up in one nine one eight many german speaking austrians hoped to join with germany in the realignment of europe but the treaty of versailles and the treaty of saint germain of one nine one nine explicitly vetoed the inclusion of austria within a german state because france and britain feared the power of a larger germany in the early one nine three zero s popular
support for union with germany remained overwhelming and the austrian government looked to a possible customs union with germany in one nine three one however hitler s and the nazis rise to power in germany left the austrian government with little enthusiasm for such formal ties hitler born in austria had promoted an all german reich from
the early beginnings of his leadership in the nsdap and had publicly stated as early as one nine two four in mein kampf that he would attempt a union by force if necessary austria shared the economic turbulence of post one nine two nine europe with a high unemployment rate and unstable commerce and industry similar to its northern and southern neighbours these uncertain conditions made the young democracy very vulnerable the first republic dominated from the late one nine two zero s by the catholic nationalist christian social party
cs gradually disintegrated from one nine three three dissolution of parliament
and ban of the austrian national socialists to one nine three four austrian civil war in february and ban of
all remaining parties except the cs and evolved into a pseudo fascist corporatist model of one party government which combined the cs and the paramilitary heimwehr with absolute state domination of labour relations and no freedom of the press see austrofascism and patriotic front power was centralized in the office of the chancellor who was empowered to rule by decree the predominance of the christian social party whose economic policies
were based on the papal encyclical rerum novarum was an austrian phenomenon in that austria s national identity had strong catholic elements which were incorporated into
the movement by way of clerical authoritarian tendencies which are certainly not to be found in nazism both engelbert dollfuss and his successor kurt schuschnigg turned to austria s other fascist neighbour italy for inspiration and support indeed the statist corporatism often referred to as austrofascism bore more resemblance to italian fascism than german national socialism benito mussolini was able to support the independent aspirations of the austrian dictatorship until his need for german
support in ethiopia forced him into a client relationship with berlin that began with the one nine three seven berlin rome axis when chancellor dollfuss was assassinated by the illegal austrian nazi party on two five july one nine three four in a failed coup the second civil war within only one year followed lasting until august one nine three four after the
failed nazi coup many leading austrian nazis fled to germany and continued to coordinate their steps from there while the remaining austrian nazis started to make use of terrorist attacks against the austrian governmental institutions causing a death toll of more than eight zero zero between one nine three four and one nine three eight dollfuss successor schuschnigg who followed the political course of dollfuss took drastic actions against the nazis for instance the rounding up of nazis but also social democrats in internment camps the anschluss of one nine three eight hitler
s first moves alfred jansa was forced to retire as chief of staff in january one nine three eight in early one nine three eight hitler had consolidated his power in germany and was ready to reach out to fulfil his long planned expansion after a lengthy period of pressure by germany hitler met schuschnigg on one two february one nine three eight in berchtesgaden bavaria and instructed
him to lift the ban of the austrian nazi party reinstate
full party freedoms release all imprisoned members of the nazi party and let them participate in the government otherwise he would take military action schuschnigg complied with hitler s demands and appointed arthur seyss inquart a nazi lawyer as interior minister and another nazi edmund glaise horstenau as minister without portfolio even before the february meeting schuschnigg was under considerable pressure from germany this may be seen in the demand to remove the chief of staff of the austrian army alfred jansa from his office in january one nine three eight jansa and his staff
had developed a scenario for austria s defence against a german attack a situation hitler wanted to avoid at all costs schuschnigg subsequently complied with the demand during the following weeks schuschnigg realized that his newly appointed ministers were gradually working on taking over his authority schuschnigg tried to gather support throughout austria and inflame patriotism among the people for the first time since one two february one nine three four the time of the austrian civil war socialists and communists
could legally appear in public again the communists announced their unconditional support for the austrian government understandable in light of nazi pressure on austria the socialists demanded further concessions from schuschnigg before
they were willing to side with him schuschnigg announces a referendum on nine march as a last resort to preserve austria s independence schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite on the independence of austria for one three march to secure a large majority
in the referendum schuschnigg set the minimum voting age at two four in order to exclude younger voters who largely sympathized with nazi ideology holding a referendum was a highly risky gamble for schuschnigg and on the next day it became apparent that hitler would not simply stand by while austria declared its independence by public vote hitler declared that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud
and that germany would not accept it in addition the german ministry
of propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in austria and that large parts of the austrian population were calling for german troops to restore order schuschnigg immediately publicly replied that the reports of riots were nothing but lies as they actually were hitler sent an ultimatum to schuschnigg on one one march demanding that he hand over all power to the austrian national socialists or face an invasion the ultimatum was set to expire at noon but was extended by two hours however
without waiting for an answer hitler had already signed the order to send troops into austria at one o clock issuing it to hermann g ring only hours later schuschnigg desperately sought support for austrian independence in the hours following the ultimatum but realizing that neither france nor the united kingdom were willing to take steps he resigned as chancellor that evening in the radio broadcast in which he announced his resignation he argued that he accepted the changes and allowed the nazis to take over the government in order to avoid bloodshed meanwhile
austrian president wilhelm miklas refused to appoint seyss inquart chancellor and asked other austrian politicians such as michael skubl and sigismund schilhawsky to assume the office however the nazis were well organised within hours they managed to take control of many parts of vienna including the ministry of internal affairs controlling
the police as miklas continued to refuse to appoint a nazi government and seyss inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the austrian government demanding german troops to restore order hitler became furious at about
one zero pm well after hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion g ring and hitler gave up on waiting and published a forged telegram containing a request by the austrian government for german troops to enter austria around midnight after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into nazi hands in vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested miklas finally conceded to appoint seyss inquart chancellor german troops march into austria propaganda even in the voting booth on one zero april one nine three eight with
a poster instructing voters how to vote yes on the morning of one two march the eight th army of the german wehrmacht crossed the german austrian border they did not face resistance by the austrian army on the contrary the german troops were greeted by cheering austrians although the invading forces were badly organized and coordination between the units was poor it mattered little because no fighting took place it did however serve as a warning for commanders in future german military
operations such as that against czechoslovakia curiously the invasion claimed its first fatality within only a few hours the nazi heinrich kurz von goldstein died of a heart attack during the celebrations
in salzburg hitler s car crossed the border in the afternoon at braunau his birthplace in the evening he arrived at linz and was given an enthusiastic welcome in the city hall the atmosphere was so intense that g ring in a telephone call that evening stated there is unbelievable jubilation in austria we ourselves did not think that sympathies would be so intense hitler s further travel through austria changed into a triumphal tour that climaxed in vienna when around two zero zero zero zero zero austrians gathered on the heldenplatz square of heroes to hear hitler
proclaim the austrian anschluss video hitler proclaims austria s inclusion in the reich two mb hitler later commented certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on austria with brutal methods i can only say even in death they cannot stop lying i have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people but when i crossed the former frontier into austria there met me such a stream of love as i have never experienced not as tyrants have we come but as liberators the
anschluss was given immediate effect by legislative act on one three march subject to ratification by a plebiscite austria became the province of ostmark and seyss inquart was appointed governor the plebiscite was held on one zero april and officially recorded a
support of nine nine seven three of the voters while historians concur that the result itself was not manipulated the voting process was not free or secret officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received
the voting ballot by hand in contrast to a secret vote where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box in addition hitler s brutal methods to emasculate any opposition had been immediately implemented in the weeks preceding the referendum even before the first german soldier crossed the border heinrich himmler and a few ss officers landed in vienna to arrest prominent representatives of the first republic such as richard schmitz leopold figl friedrich hillegeist and franz olah during the weeks following the anschluss and before the plebiscite social democrats communists and other potential
political dissenters as well as jews were rounded up and either imprisoned or sent to concentration camps within only a few days of one two march seven zero
zero zero zero people had been arrested the referendum itself was subject to large scale propaganda and to the abrogation of the voting rights of around four zero zero zero zero zero people nearly one zero of the eligible voting
population mainly former members of left wing parties and jews interestingly in some remote areas of austria the referendum on the independence of austria on one three march was held despite the wehrmacht s presence in austria it took up to three days to occupy every part of austria for instance in the village of innervillgraten a majority of nine five voted for
austria s independence austria remained part of the third reich until the end of world war ii when a preliminary austrian government declared the anschluss void and null on april two seven one nine four five after the war then allied occupied austria was recognized and treated as a separate country but was not restored to sovereignty until the austrian state treaty and austrian declaration of neutrality both of one nine five five largely due to the rapid development of the cold war and disputes between the soviet union and its former allies over its foreign
policy reactions and consequences of the anschluss social democrat karl renner publicly announced his support for the anschluss the picture of austria in the first days of its existence in the third reich is one of contradictions at one and the same time hitler s terror regime began to tighten its grip in every area of society beginning with mass
arrests and thousands of austrians attempting to flee in every direction yet austrians could be seen
cheering and welcoming german troops entering austrian territory many austrian
political figures did not hesitate to announce their support of the anschluss and their relief that it happened without violence cardinal theodor innitzer a political figure of the cs declared as early as one two march the viennese catholics should thank the lord for the bloodless way this great political change has occurred and
they should pray for a great future for austria needless to say everyone should obey the orders of the new institutions the other austrian bishops followed suit some days later vatican radio however immediately broadcast a vehement denunciation of the german action and cardinal pacelli ordered innitzer to report to rome before meeting with the pope innitzer met with pacelli who had been outraged by innitzer s statement he made it clear that innitzer needed to retract he was made to sign a new statement issued on behalf of all the austrian bishops which provided the solemn
declaration of the austrian bishops was clearly not intended to be an approval of something that was not and is not compatible with god s law the vatican newspaper also reported that the bishops earlier statement had been issued without the
approval from rome robert kauer president of the protestants in austria greeted hitler on one three march as saviour of the three five zero zero zero zero german protestants in austria and liberator from a five year hardship even karl renner the most famous social democrat of the first republic announced
his support for the anschluss and appealed to all austrians to vote in favour of it on one zero april the international response to the expansion of germany may be described as moderate the times commented that two zero zero years ago scotland had joined england as well and that this event
would not really differ much on one four march the british prime minister neville chamberlain noted in the house of commons british appeasement policy led to the treaty of munich the next major step for hitler to create an all german reich his majesty s government have throughout been in
the closest touch with the situation the foreign secretary saw the german foreign minister on the one zero th of march and addressed to him a grave warning on the austrian situation and upon what appeared to be the policy of the german government in regard to it late on the one one th of march our ambassador in berlin registered a protest in strong terms with the german government against such use of coercion backed by force against an independent state in order to
create a situation incompatible with its national independence however the speech concluded i imagine that according to the temperament of the individual the events which
are in our minds to day will be the cause of regret of sorrow perhaps of indignation they cannot be regarded by his majesty s government with indifference or equanimity they are bound to have effects which cannot yet be measured the immediate result must
be to intensify the sense of uncertainty and insecurity in europe unfortunately while the policy of appeasement would lead to a relaxation of the economic pressure under which many countries are suffering to day what has just occurred must inevitably retard economic recovery and indeed increased care will be required to ensure that marked deterioration does not set in this
is not a moment for hasty decisions or for careless words we must consider
the new situation quickly but with cool judgement as regards our defence programmes we have always made it clear that they were flexible and that they would have to be reviewed from time to time in the light of any development in the international situation it would be idle to pretend that recent events do not constitute a change of the kind that we had in mind accordingly we have decided to make a fresh review and in due course we shall announce what further steps we may think it necessary to take the lenient reaction to the anschluss was
the first major consequence of the strictly followed appeasement british foreign policy strategy the international reaction on the
events of march one two th one nine three eight led hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his roadmap to expand the third reich as he would later in annexing the sudetenland the relatively bloodless anschluss helped pave the way for the treaty of munich in september one nine three eight and the annexation of czechoslovakia in one nine three nine because it reinforced appeasement as the right way for britain to deal with hitler s germany legacy of the one nine three eight anschluss
the anschluss annexation or union some historical sources for instance encyclop dia britannica and the encarta encyclopedia describe the anschluss as an annexation outside this context anschluss is properly translated as join connection unification or political union the german word annektierung would mean military annexation
unambiguously however the word commonly used in german for the process of spring one nine three eight is anschluss the precise character of the anschluss remains a difficulty essential to austria s understanding of its history and the obligations it entails the appeal of nazism to austrians the anschluss can be misunderstood as simply a military annexation of an unwilling austria but this lends itself to confusion with other german military occupations of european countries it also tends to conceal the culpability of many
austrians in nazi crimes most of all the holocaust by perpetuating the myth of austria as the first victim of hitler s expansionism despite the subversion of austrian political process by hitler s sympathisers and associates in austria austrian acceptance of direct government by hitler s berlin is a very different phenomenon from the administration of other collaborationist countries with the break up of the austro hungarian monarchy in one nine one eight popular opinion was
for unification with germany in realization of the grossdeutschland concept this however was forbidden by the treaty of st germain to which the newly formed austrian republic was obliged this
was in stark contrast to the general concept of self determination which governed the versailles talks as was the inclusion of the sudetenland a german populated area of the former austro hungarian province of bohemia whose population favoured
joining german speaking austria in the newly formed czechoslovak republic giving rise to revisionist sentiment this laid the grounds for the general willingness of the populations of both austria and the sudetenland for inclusion into the third reich as well as the relative acceptance of the western governments who made little protest until march one nine three nine when the irredentist argument lost its value following the annexation of the rest of czech speaking
bohemia as well as moravia and czech silesia nazi propaganda poster
the small republic of austria was seen by many of its citizens as economically unviable a feeling that was exacerbated by the depression of the one nine three zero s in contrast the nazi dictatorship appeared to have found a solution to the economic crisis of the one nine three zero s furthermore the break up
had thrown austria into a crisis of identity and many austrians of both the left and the right felt that austria should be part of a larger german nation politically austria had not had the time to develop a strongly democratic society
to resist the onslaught of totalitarianism the final version of the first republic s constitution had
only lasted from one nine two nine to one nine three three the first republic was ridden by violent strife between the different political camps the christian social party were complicit in the murder of large numbers of adherents of the decidedly left wing social democratic party by the police during the july revolt of one nine two seven in fact with the end of democracy in one nine three three and the establishment of
austrofascism austria had already purged its democratic institutions and instituted a dictatorship long before the anschluss there is thus little to distinguish radically the institutions of at least the post one nine three four austrian government before
or after one two march one nine three eight the members of the leading christian social party were fervent catholics but not particularly anti semitic for instance jews were not prohibited from exercising any profession in sharp contrast to the third reich many prominent austrian scientists professors and lawyers at the time were jewish in fact vienna with its jewish population of about two zero zero zero zero zero was considered a safe haven from one nine three three to one nine three eight by many jews who fled nazi germany however the nazis
anti semitism found fertile soil in austria anti semitic elements had emerged as a force in austrian politics in the late nineteenth century with the rise in prominence of figures such as georg ritter von sch nerer and karl lueger who had influenced the young hitler and in the one nine three zero s anti semitism was rampant as
jews were a convenient scapegoat for economic problems in addition to the economic appeal of the anschluss the popular underpinning of nazi politics as a total art form the refinement of film propaganda exemplified by riefenstahl s triumph of the will and mythological aestheticism of a broadly conceived national destiny of the german people within a thousand year reich gave the nazis a massive advantage in advancing their claims to power moreover austrofascism was less grand in its appeal than the choice between stalin and hitler to which many european intellectuals of the time believed themselves reduced by
the end of the decade austria had effectively no alternative view of its historical mission when the choice was upon it in spite of dollfuss and schuschnigg s hostility to nazi political ambitions the nazis succeeded in convincing many austrians to accept what they viewed as the historical destiny of the german people rather than continue as part of a distinct sovereign nation the second republic the moscow declaration arthur seyss inquart one nine four five mugshot for the nuremberg trials the moscow declaration of one

the soviet union and the united states of america are agreed that austria the first free country to fall a victim to hitlerite aggression shall be liberated from german domination they regard the annexation imposed on austria by germany on one five march one nine three eight as null and void they consider themselves as in no way bound by any charges affected in austria since that date they declare that they
wish to see re established a free and independent austria and thereby to open the way for the austrian people themselves as well as those neighbouring states which will be face with similar problems to find that political and economic security which is the only basis for lasting peace
austria is reminded however that she has a responsibility which she cannot evade for participation in the war at the side of hitlerite germany and that in the final settlement
account will inevitably be taken of her own contribution to her liberation to judge from the last paragraph and subsequent determinations at the nuremberg trial the declaration was intended to serve as propaganda aimed at stirring austrian resistance although there are austrians counted as righteous among the nations there never was an effective austrian armed resistance of the
sort found in other countries under german occupation more than anything else although the exact text of the declaration is said to have a somewhat complex drafting history at nuremberg arthur seyss inquart and franz von papen in particular were both indicted under count one conspiracy to commit crimes against peace specifically for their activities in support of the austrian nazi party and the anschluss but neither was convicted of this count in acquitting von papen the court noted that his actions were in its view political immoralities but not crimes under its charter seyss
inquart was convicted of other serious war crimes most of which took place in poland and the netherlands and was sentenced to death austrian identity and the victim theory heldenplatz day of the austrian legion two april one nine three eight after world war ii many austrians sought comfort in the myth of austria as the nazis first victim although the nazi party was promptly banned austria did not have the same thorough process of de nazification at the top of government which was imposed on germany for a time lacking outside pressure for political
reform factions of austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that the anschluss was only an annexation at bayonet point this view of the events of one nine three eight has deep roots in the ten years of allied occupation and the struggle to regain austrian sovereignty the victim theory played an essential role in the negotiations on the austrian state treaty with the soviets and
by pointing to the moscow declaration austrian politicians heavily relied on it to achieve a solution for austria different from the division into east and west in germany the state treaty alongside with the subsequent austrian declaration
of permanent neutrality marked important milestones for the solidification of
austria s independent national identity during the following decades as austrian politicians of the left and right attempted to reconcile their differences in order to avoid the violent conflict that had
dominated the first republic discussions of both austrofascism and austria s role in nazism were largely avoided still the austrian people s party vp has advanced and still sometimes advances the argument that the establishment of the dollfuss dictatorship was necessary in order to maintain austrian independence while the austrian social democratic party sp
argues that the dictatorship stripped the country of the democratic resources necessary to repel hitler political events for decades the victim theory established in the austrian mind remained largely undisputed the austrian public was only rarely forced to confront the legacy of the third reich most notably during the events of one nine six five concerning taras borodajkewycz a professor of economic history notorious
for anti semitic remarks when ernst kirchweger a concentration camp survivor was killed by a right wing protester during riots it was not until the one nine eight zero s that austrians were finally massively confronted with their past the main catalyst for the start of a vergangenheitsbew ltigung was the so called waldheim affair the austrian reply to allegations during the one nine eight six presidential election campaign that successful candidate and former un secretary general kurt waldheim had
been a member of the nazi party and of the infamous sa he was later absolved of direct involvement in war crimes was that scrutiny was an unwelcome intervention in the country s internal affairs despite the politicians reactions to international criticism of waldheim the waldheim affair started the first serious major discussion
on austria s past and the anschluss another main factor for austria and its coming to terms with the past emerged in the one nine eight zero s j rg haider and the rise of the fp the party had combined elements of the pan german right with free market liberalism since its foundation in one nine five five but after haider had ascended to the party chairmanship in one nine eight six the liberal elements became increasingly marginalized while haider began to openly use nationalist and anti immigrant rhetoric he was
often criticised for tactics such as the v lkisch ethnic definition of national interest austria for austrians and his apologism for austria s past notably calling members of the waffen ss men of honour following an enormous
electoral rise in the one nine nine zero s peaking in the one nine nine nine elections the fp now purged of its liberal elements entered a coalition with the vp led by wolfgang sch ssel that met international condemnation in two zero zero zero this coalition triggered the
regular donnerstagsdemonstrationen thursday demonstrations in protest against the government which took place on the heldenplatz where hitler had greeted the masses
during the anschluss haider s tactics and rhetoric which were often criticised as sympathetic to nazism again forced austrians to reconsider their relationship
to the past but it is not j rg haider alone who has made questionable remarks on austria s past j rg haider s coalition partner the current chancellor wolfgang sch ssel in an interview with the jerusalem post as late as two zero zero zero stated that
austria was the first victim of hitler germany literature tearing into the simplism of the victim theory and
the time of the austrofascism thomas bernhard s last play heldenplatz was highly controversial even before it appeared on stage in one nine eight eight fifty years after hitler s visit bernhard s achievement was to make the elimination of references to hitler s reception in vienna emblematic of austrian attempts to claim
their history and culture under questionable criteria many politicians from all political factions called bernhard a nestbeschmutzer
so damaging the reputation of his country and openly demanded that the play should not be staged in vienna s burgtheater kurt waldheim who was at that time still austrian president called the play a crude insult to the austrian people the historical commission and outstanding legal issues in the context of the postwar federal republic of germany one encounters a vergangenheitsbew ltigung struggle to come to terms with the past that has been partially institutionalised variably in literary cultural political and educational contexts its development and difficulties have not been trivial see for example the
historikerstreit austria formed a historikerkommission historian s commission or historical commission in one nine nine eight with a mandate to
review austria s role in the nazi expropriation of jewish property from a scholarly rather than legal perspective partly in response to continuing criticism of its handling of property claims its membership was based on recommendations from various quarters including simon wiesenthal and yad vashem the commission delivered its report in two zero zero three noted holocaust historian raul hilberg refused to participate in the commission and in an interview stated his strenuous objections in terms both personal and in reference to larger questions about austrian
culpability and liability comparing what he to be relative inattention to the settlement governing the swiss bank holdings of those who died or were displaced by the holocaust i personally would like to know why the wjc world jewish congress has hardly put any pressure on austria even as leading nazis and ss
leaders were austrians hitler included immediately after the war the us wanted to make the russians withdraw from austria and the russians wanted to keep austria neutral therefore
there was a common interest to grant austria victim status and later austria could cry poor though its per capita income is as high as germany s and most importantly the austrian pr machinery works better austria has the opera ball the imperial castle mozartkugeln a chocolate americans like that and austrians invest and export relatively little to the us therefore they are less vulnerable to blackmail in the meantime they set up a commission in austria to clarify what happened to jewish property victor klima the former chancellor has asked me to join my father fought
for austria in the first world war and in one nine three nine he was kicked out of austria after the war they offered him ten dollars per month as compensation for this reason i told klima no thank you this makes me sick the simon wiesenthal center continues to criticise austria as recently as june two zero zero five for its alleged historical and ongoing unwillingness aggressively to pursue investigations and trials against nazis for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the seventies onwards its two zero zero one report offered the
following characterization given the extensive participation of numerous austrians including at the highest levels in the implementation of the final solution and other nazi crimes austria should have been a leader in the prosecution of holocaust perpetrators over the course of the past four decades as has been the case in germany unfortunately relatively little has been achieved by the austrian authorities in this regard and in fact with the exception
of the case of dr heinrich gross which was suspended this year under highly suspicious circumstances he claimed to be medically unfit but outside the court proved to be healthy not a single nazi war crimes prosecution has been conducted in austria since the mid seventies in two zero zero three the center launched a worldwide effort named operation last chance in order to collect further information about those nazis still alive that are potentially subject to prosecution
although reports issued shortly thereafter credited austria for initiating large scale investigations there has been one case where criticism of austrian authorities arose recently the center has put nine two year old croatian milivoj asner on its two zero zero five top ten list asner fled to austria in two zero zero four after croatia announced it would start investigations in the case of war crimes he may have been involved
in in response to objections about asner s continued freedom austria s federal government has deferred to either extradition requests from croatia or prosecutorial actions from klagenfurt neither of which appears forthcoming as of june two zero zero five extradition is not an option since asner also holds austrian citizenship having lived in the country from one nine four six to one nine nine one austrian political and military leaders in nazi germany arthur seyss inquart ernst kaltenbrunner odilo globocnik amon g th lothar rendulic alfred ritter von hubicki

that had seceded one from the union the union won a decisive victory followed by a period of reconstruction the war produced more than nine seven zero zero zero zero casualties three percent of population including approximately five six zero zero zero zero deaths the causes of the war the reasons for the outcome and even the name of the
war itself are subjects of much controversy even today historiography multiple explanations of why war began main articles origins of the american civil war timeline of events the origin of the american civil war lay in the complex issues of slavery politics disagreements over the scope of states rights versus federal power expansionism sectionalism economics modernization and competing nationalism of the antebellum period although there is little disagreement among historians on the details of the events that led to war there is disagreement on exactly what caused
what and the relative importance there is no consensus on whether the war could have been avoided or if it should have been avoided failure to compromise in one eight five four the old political system broke down after passage of
the kansas nebraska act the whig party disappeared and the new republican party arose in its place it was the nation s first major
political party with only sectional appeal though it had much of the old whig economic platform its popularity rested on its commitment to stop the expansion of slavery into new territories open warfare in the kansas territory the panic of one eight five seven and john brown s raid on harper s ferry further heightened sectional tensions and helped republicans sweep elections in one eight six zero in one eight six zero the election of abraham lincoln who met staunch opposition from southern
slave owning interests triggered southern secession from the union the new president decided to resort to arms if necessary to preserve the nation s
territorial integrity historians in the one nine three zero s such as james g randall argued that the rise of mass democracy the breakdown of the old two party system and increasingly virulent and hostile sectional rhetoric made it highly unlikely if not impossible to bring about the compromises of the past such as the missouri compromise
and the compromise of one eight five zero necessary to avoid crisis although numerous compromises were proposed none were successful in reuniting the country one possible compromise was peaceful secession agreed to by the united states which was seriously discussed in late one eight six zero and supported by many abolitionists but was rejected by both buchanan s conservative democrats and the republican leadership southern nationalism
psychological nationhood most historians agree following ulrich b phillips avery craven and eugene genovese that the south had grown apart from the north psychologically and in terms of its value systems one by one the common elements that bound the nation together were broken for example the major protestant denominations split along north south lines fewer
travelers or students or businessmen went from one region to the other the last common elements were the constitution which was in dispute after the dred scott ruling of one eight five seven the political parties which split along regional lines in one eight six zero and congress which was in constant turmoil after one eight five six slavery as a cause
of the war focus on the slavery issue has been cyclical it was considered the main cause in the one eight six zero
one eight nine zero era from one nine zero zero to one nine six zero historians considered anti slavery agitation to be less important than constitutional economic and cultural issues
since the one nine six zero s historians have returned to an emphasis on slavery as a major cause of the war specifically they note that the south insisted on protecting it and the north insisted on weakening it a small but militant abolitionist movement existed in the north a matter of a few thousand advocates their insistence that slavery was a
sin and slave owners were deeply guilty angered the south historians
have looked at many slave owners and decided that they felt neither guilt nor shame but were angry at what they considered unchristian hate speech from abolitionists by the
one eight three zero s there was a widespread ideological defense of the peculiar institution everywhere in the south as territorial expansion forced the nation to confront the question of whether new territories were to become slave or free and as multiplying free states became a majority in the union the slave power in national politics waned economics the north and south did have different economies but they were complementary and not
in competition the south made money by exporting cotton and
other unique crops like tobacco the north made money by exporting food and manufactured items many northern business interests were closely tied to the southern economy and pleaded for union and compromise some southerners thought they paid too much in tariffs but they themselves had written and voted for the tariff laws in effect the cotton growing export business or king cotton as it was touted was so important to the world economy southerners argued that they could stand alone indeed being tied to
the north was a hindrance and an economic burden the south would do better by trading directly with europe and avoiding extortionate yankee middlemen ideologies in the view of many northern republicans the slave power ruled the south not democracy this slave power
was a small group of very wealthy slave owners especially cotton planters who dominated the politics and society
of the south however historians more recently have emphasized that the south was much more
democratic than the republicans of north believed both north and south believed strongly to republican values of
democracy and civic virtue but their conceptualizations were diverging each side though the other was aggressive and was violating both the constitution and the core values of american republicanism nationalism was the dominant force in europe in the one nine th century and likewise in america the south was much more explicit in defining nationalism as a regional characteristic the north paid less attention to nationalism
before one eight six zero but then focused its mind on it and stressed the whole country north and south was the unit of nationalism this economic differentiation had social and political consequences beyond the issue of slavery itself for instance
pennsylvania politicians pushed for a protective tariff to help the iron industry while the cotton exporting south wanted to keep the existing policy of nearly free trade at a deeper level industrialization in the northeast and farming in the midwest depended on free labor which could not exist alongside slave labor as lincoln kept emphasizing the nation had to be all free or
all slave said lincoln historians charles and mary beard went so far as to argue in one nine two eight that this sectional conflict was a second american revolution a revolutionary watershed in the rise of modern industrial society in the united states states rights the states rights debate cut across the issues southern politicians argued that the federal government had no power to prevent slaves from being carried
into new territories but they also demanded federal jurisdiction over slaves who escaped into the north northern politicians took reversed though equally contradictory stances on these issues slavery in the territories the specific political crisis that culminated in secession and civil war stemmed from a dispute over the expansion of slavery into new territories the reason was that congress had power over slavery in the territories but not in the states with new territories being formed especially kansas the issue of slaver had to be confronted this argument grew out of the acquisition of vast new lands
during the mexican war one eight four six four eight free state politicians such as
david wilmot who personally had no sympathy for abolitionism feared that slaves would provide too much competition for free labor and thus effectively keep free state migrants out of newly opened territories slaveholders felt that any ban on slaves in the territories was a discrimination against their peculiar form of property and would undercut both the financial value of slaves and the institution itself slaves comprised the second most valuable form of property in the south after real estate in congress the end of the mexican
war was overshadowed by a fight over the wilmot proviso a provision that wilmot tried and failed to enact to bar slavery from all lands acquired in the conflict the dispute led to open warfare after the kansas territory was organized in the kansas nebraska
act of one eight five four this act repealed the prohibition on slavery there under the missouri compromise of one eight two zero and put the fate of slavery in the hands of the territory s settlers a process known as popular sovereignty proslavery missourians expected that kansas due west of their state would naturally become a slave state and were alarmed by an organized migration of
antislavery new englanders soon heavily armed border ruffians from missouri battled antislavery forces under john brown among other leaders hundreds were killed or wounded southern congressmen perceiving a northern conspiracy to keep slavery out of kansas insisted that it be admitted as a slave state northerners pointing to the large and growing majority of antislavery voters there denounced this effort by one eight six zero sectional divisions had grown deep and bitter abraham lincoln one six th president one eight six one one eight six five southern fears of modernity southern
secession was triggered by the election of republican abraham lincoln because it was feared that he
would make good on his promise to stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction if not lincoln then sooner or later another yankee many southerners said it was time to quit the union the slave states had lost the balance of power in the electoral college and the senate and were facing a future as a perpetual minority in a broader sense the north was rapidly modernizing its economy and its world view slavery had

both missouri and kentucky remained in the union but factions within each state organized governments in exile that were recognized by the csa in missouri an elected convention on

repeatedly rejected confederate overtures now decided that they could not send forces against the seceding states they seceded and to reward virginia the confederate capital was moved
to richmond virginia a highly vulnerable location at the end of the supply line even though the southern states had seceded there was considerable anti secessionist sentiment within several of the seceding states
eastern tennessee in particular was a hotbed for pro unionism winston county alabama issued a resolution of secession from the state of alabama the red strings were a prominent southern anti secession group winfield scott created the
anaconda plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible his idea was that a union blockade would strangle the rebel economy then capture of the mississippi would split the south lincoln adopted the plan but overruled scott s warnings against an immediate attack on richmond naval war and blockade union blockade and confederate states navy in may one eight six one lincoln proclaimed the union blockade of all southern ports which shut down nearly all international traffic and most local port to port traffic although few naval battles were fought and few
men were killed the blockade shut down king cotton and ruined the southern economy british investors built small very fast blockade runners that brought in military supplies and civilian luxuries from cuba and the bahamas and took out some cotton and tobacco when the blockade captured one the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the union sailors the crews were british so when they were captured they were released and not held as prisoners of war the most famous naval battle
was the battle of hampton roads often called the battle of the monitor and the merrimac in march one eight six two in which confederate efforts to break the blockade were frustrated other naval battles included island no one zero memphis drewry s bluff arkansas post and mobile bay eastern theater one eight six one one eight six three because of the fierce resistance of
a few initial confederate forces at manassas virginia in july one eight six one a march by union troops under the command of maj gen irvin mcdowell on the confederate forces there was halted in the first battle of bull run or first manassas whereupon they were forced back to washington d c by confederate troops under the command of generals joseph e johnston and p g t beauregard it was in this battle that confederate general thomas jackson received the name of stonewall because he stood like a stone wall against union troops alarmed at the
loss and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the union the u s congress passed the crittenden johnson resolution on july two five of that year which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the union
and not to end slavery major general george b mcclellan took command of the union army of the potomac on july two six he was briefly general in chief of all the union armies but was subsequently relieved of
that post in favor of maj gen henry w halleck and the war began in earnest in one eight six two upon the strong urging of president lincoln to begin offensive operations mcclellan invaded virginia in the spring of one eight six two by way of the peninsula between the york river and james river southeast of richmond although mcclellan s army reached the gates of richmond in the peninsula campaign joseph e johnston halted his advance at the battle of seven pines
then robert e lee defeated him in the seven days battles and forced his retreat mcclellan
was stripped of many of his troops to reinforce john pope s union army of virginia pope was beaten spectacularly by lee in the northern virginia campaign and the second battle of bull run in august confederate dead behind the stone wall of marye s heights fredericksburg virginia killed during the battle of chancellorsville may one eight six three emboldened by second bull run the confederacy made its first invasion of the north when general lee led five five zero zero zero men of the army of northern

follow up on antietam he was replaced by maj gen ambrose burnside burnside suffered near immediate defeat at the battle of fredericksburg on december one three one eight six two when over ten thousand union soldiers were killed or wounded after the battle burnside was replaced by maj gen joseph fighting joe hooker hooker too proved unable to defeat lee s army despite outnumbering the confederates by more than two to one he was humiliated in the battle of chancellorsville in may one eight six three he was replaced by maj gen george

confederate forces had numerous successes in the eastern theater they crucially failed in the west

one clear confederate victory in the west was the battle of chickamauga in georgia near the tennessee border where bragg reinforced by the corps of james longstreet from lee s army in the east defeated rosecrans despite the heroic defensive stand of george henry thomas and forced him to retreat to chattanooga which bragg then besieged the union s key strategist and tactician in the west was maj gen ulysses s grant who won victories at forts henry and donelson by which the union seized control of the tennessee

confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war he devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of confederacy from multiple directions generals grant meade and benjamin butler would move against lee near richmond general franz sigel and later philip sheridan would invade the shenandoah valley general sherman would and capture
atlanta and march to the sea generals george crook and william w averell would operate against railroad supply lines in west virginia and general nathaniel banks would capture mobile alabama
union forces in the east attempted to maneuver past lee and fought several battles during that phase grant s overland campaign of the eastern campaign an attempt to outflank lee from
the south failed under butler who was trapped inside the bermuda hundred river bend grant was tenacious and despite astonishing losses over six six zero zero zero casualties in six weeks kept pressing lee s army of northern virginia back to richmond he pinned down the confederate army in the siege of petersburg where the two armies engaged in trench warfare for over nine months grant
finally found a commander general philip sheridan aggressive enough to prevail in the valley campaigns of one eight six four sheridan proved to be more than a match for jubal early
and defeated him in a series of battles including a final decisive defeat at cedar creek sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the valley a strategy similar to the tactics sherman would later employ in georgia meanwhile sherman marched from chattanooga to atlanta defeating confederate generals joseph e johnston and john b hood the fall of atlanta on september two one eight six four was
a significant factor in the re election of abraham lincoln as president of the union leaving atlanta and his base of supplies sherman s army marched with an unclear destination laying waste to about two zero of the farms in georgia in his celebrated march to the sea and reaching the atlantic ocean at savannah georgia in december one eight six four burning plantations as they went sherman s army was followed by thousands of freed slaves when sherman turned north through south carolina and north carolina to approach the virginia lines from the
south it was the end for lee and his men and for the confederacy lee attempted to escape from the besieged petersburg and link up with johnston in north carolina but he was overtaken by grant he surrendered his army of northern virginia on april nine one eight six five at appomattox court house johnston surrendered his troops to sherman shortly thereafter at a local family s farmhouse in durham north carolina the battle of palmito ranch fought on may one three one eight six five in the far south
of texas was the last civil war land battle and ended ironically with a confederate victory all confederate land forces surrendered by june one
eight six five analysis of the outcome why the union prevailed or
why the confederacy was defeated in the civil war has been a subject of extensive analysis and debate could the south have won a significant number of scholars believe that the union held an insurmountable advantage over the confederacy in terms of industrial strength population and the
determination to win confederate actions they argue could only delay defeat southern historian shelby foote expressed this view succinctly in ken burns s television series on the civil war i think that the north fought that war with one hand behind its back if there had been more southern victories and a lot more the north simply would have brought
that other hand out from behind its back i don t think the south ever had a chance to win that war ward one nine nine zero p two seven two other historians however suggest that the south had a chance to win its independence as james mcpherson has observed the confederacy remained on the defensive which required fewer military resources the union committed to the strategic offensive faced enormous manpower demands that it often had difficulty meeting war weariness among union civilians mounted along with casualties
in the long years before union advantages proved decisive thus the inevitability of union victory remains hotly contested among scholars the goals were not symmetric to win independence the south had to convince the north it could not win but it did not have to invade the north to restore the union the north had to conquer vast stretches
of territory in the short run a matter of months the two sides were evenly matched but in the long run a matter of years the north had advantages that increasingly came into play both sides had long term advantages but the union had more of them the union had to control the entire coastline defeat
all the main confederate armies seize richmond and control most of the population centers as the occupying force they had to station hundreds of thousands of soldiers to control railroads supply lines and major towns and cites the long term advantages widely credited by historians to have contributed to the union s success include us economic advantages over csa the more industrialized economy of the north which aided in the production of arms munitions and supplies as
well as finances and transportation the graph shows the relative advantage of the usa over the csa a party system that enabled the republicans to mobilize soldiers and support at the grass roots even when the war became unpopular the confederacy deliberately did not use parties the union population was two two million and the south nine million in one eight six one the disparity grew as the union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons and cut off the trans mississippi part of the confederacy excellent railroad links between union
cities which allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies transportation was much slower and
more difficult in the south which was unable to augment its much smaller system or repair damage or even perform routine maintenance the union devoted much more of its resources to medical needs thereby overcoming the unhealthy disease environment that sickened and killed more soldiers than combat did the union at the start controlled over eight zero of the shipyards
steamships river boats and the navy it augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program this enabled the union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline the union s more established government particularly a mature executive branch which accumulated even greater power during wartime may have resulted in less regional infighting and a more streamlined conduct of the war failure of davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors damaged the confederate president s ability to draw on regional resources the confederacy s tactic of
engaging in major battles at the cost of heavy manpower losses when it could not easily replace its losses the confederacy s failure to fully use its advantages in guerrilla warfare against union communication and transportation infrastructure however as lee warned such warfare would prove devastating to the south and with the exception of confederate partisans in missouri confederate leaders shrank from it despite the union s many tactical blunders like the seven days battle those commited by confederate generals such as lee s miscalculations
at the battle of gettysburg and battle of antietam were far more serious if for no other reason than that the confederates could so little afford the losses lincoln proved more adept than davis in replacing unsuccessful generals with better ones strategically the location of the capital richmond tied lee to a highly exposed position at the end of supply lines loss of richmond everyone realized meant loss
of the war lincoln grew as a grand strategist in contrast to davis the confederacy never developed an overall strategy it never had a plan to deal with the blockade davis failed to respond in a coordinated fashion to serious threats such as grant s campaign against vicksburg in one eight six three in the face of which he allowed lee to invade pennsylvania the confederacy s failure to win diplomatic or military support from any foreign powers its king cotton misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy such as the
refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started most important the union had the will to win
and leaders like lincoln seward stanton grant and sherman would do whatever it took to achieve victory the confederacy as beringer et al one nine eight six argue may have lacked the total commitment needed to win it took time however for leaders such as grant sherman and sheridan to emerge in the meantime union public opinion wavered and lincoln worried about losing the election of one eight six four until victories
in the shenandoah valley and atlanta made victory seem likely major land battles there were as many as one zero zero zero zero hostile engagements during the war the costliest and most significant are listed in battles of the american civil war civil war leaders and soldiers statues of abraham lincoln and jefferson davis at vicksburg national military park one of the reasons that the u s civil war wore on as long as it did
and the battles were so fierce was that most important generals on both sides had formerly served in the united states army some including ulysses s grant and robert e lee during the mexican american war between one eight four six and one eight four eight most were graduates of the united states military academy at west point southern military commanders and strategists included jefferson davis robert e lee joseph e johnston thomas j stonewall jackson james longstreet p g t beauregard john mosby braxton
bragg john bell hood james ewell brown jeb stuart william mahone judah p benjamin jubal early and nathan bedford forrest northern military commanders and strategists included abraham lincoln
edwin m stanton ulysses s grant william tecumseh sherman george h thomas george
b mcclellan henry w halleck joseph hooker ambrose burnside irvin mcdowell winfield scott philip sheridan george crook george armstrong custer george g meade and winfield hancock after one nine eight zero scholarly
attention turned to ordinary soldiers and to women and african americans involved with the war as james mcpherson observed the profound irony of the civil war was that confederate and union soldiers interpreted the heritage of one seven seven six in opposite ways confederates fought for
liberty and independence from what they regarded as a tyrannical government unionists fought to preserve the nation created by the founders from dismemberment and destruction mcpherson one nine nine four p two four the question of slavery given the painfulness of the historical memory of slavery for many americans its role in the war remains controversial to this day to understand its place in the conflict it
is necessary to divide the issue in two slavery as a motivation for
secession and abolition as a union war aim in the weeks and months preceding the secession of the confederate states southern leaders spoke openly about their desire to preserve slavery and their fears for the peculiar institution if the south remained within the union almost all of the ordinances of secession cited the preservation of slavery as a primary even the foremost reason
for departure from the union and yet many individual southern soldiers fought for reasons quite apart from the defense of slavery to protect their families and communities to defend their home states and out of a nascent sense of nationality on the union side lincoln initially declared his purpose in prosecuting the war to be the preservation of the union not emancipation he had no wish to alienate the thousands of slaveholders in the union border states the long war however had a radicalizing effect on federal policies with the
emancipation proclamation announced in september one eight six two and put into effect four months later lincoln adopted the abolition of the slave power as a second mission that is slaves owned by rebels had to be taken away from them and freed one goal was to destroy the economic basis of the confederate leadership class and another goal was to actually liberate the
four million slaves which was accomplished by one eight six five the emancipation proclamation declared all slaves held in territory then under confederate control to be then thenceforth and forever free but did not affect slaves in areas under union control it did however show the union that slavery s days were numbered increasing abolitionist support in the north the border states except kentucky abolished slavery on their own foreign diplomacy because of the confederacy s attempt to create a new
state recognition and support from the european powers were critical to its prospects the union under secretary of state william henry seward attempted to block the confederacy s efforts in this sphere the confederates hoped that the importance of the cotton trade to europe the idea of cotton diplomacy and shortages caused by the war along with early military
victories would enable them to gather increasing european support and force a turn away from neutrality president lincoln s decision to announce a blockade of the confederacy a clear act of war enabled britain followed by other european powers to announce their neutrality in the dispute this enabled the confederacy to begin to attempt to
gain support and funds in europe president jefferson davis had picked robert toombs of georgia as his first secretary of state toombs
having little knowledge in foreign affairs was replaced several months later by robert m t hunter of virginia another choice with little suitability ultimately on march one seven one eight six two davis selected judah p benjamin of louisiana as
secretary of state who although having more international knowledge and legal experience with international slavery disputes still failed in the end to create a dynamic foreign policy for the confederacy the first attempts to achieve european recognition of the confederacy were dispatched on february two five one eight six one and led by william lowndes yancey pierre a rost and ambrose dudley mann the british foreign minister lord john russell met with them and the french foreign minister edouard
thouvenel received the group unofficially however at this point the two countries had agreed to coordinate and cooperate and would not make any rash moves charles francis adams proved particularly adept as ambassador to britain for the union and britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the union s blockade the confederacy also
attempted to initiate propaganda in europe through journalists henry hotze and edwin de leon in paris and london however public opinion against slavery created a political liability for european politicians especially in britain a significant challenge in anglo union relations was also created by the trent affair involving the union boarding of a british mail steamer to seize james m mason and john slidell confederate diplomats sent to europe however the union was able to smooth over the
problem to some degree as the war continued in late one eight six two the british considered initiating an attempt to mediate the conflict however the union victory in the battle of antietam caused them to delay this decision additionally the issuing of the emancipation proclamation further reinforced the political liability of supporting the confederacy as the war continued the confederacy s chances
with britain grew more hopeless and they focused increasingly on france napol on iii proposed to offer mediation in january one eight six three but this was dismissed by seward despite some sympathy for the confederacy france
s own concerns in mexico ultimately deterred them from substantially antagonizing the union as the confederacy s situation grew more and more tenuous and their pleas increasingly ignored president davis sent duncan f kenner to europe in november one eight six four to test whether a promised confederate emancipation of its slaves could lead to possible recognition the proposal was strictly rejected by both britain and france aftermath the peace monument at lookout mountain tennessee depicts a union and confederate
soldier shaking hands northern leaders agreed that the war would be over when confederate nationalism was dead and slavery was dead they disagreed sharply on how to identify these goals they also disagreed on the degree of federal
control that should be imposed on the south the fighting ended with the surrender of all the confederate forces there was no significant guerrilla warfare many senior confederate leaders escaped to europe but davis was captured and imprisoned but never brought to trial the question became how much the union could trust the ex confederates to be
truly loyal to the united states the second main question in reconstruction dealt with the destruction of slavery the xiii amendment one
eight six five officially abolished it legally but the issue was whether black codes indicated a sort of semi slavery and whether freedmen should have the vote to protect
those rights in one eight six seven radicals in congress pushed aside president johnson and imposed new rules freedmen gained the right to vote and formed republican political coalitions that took control of each state for varying periods one by one the white conservatives or redeemers gained back control of their states often through lethal force the final three were redeemed by the compromise of one eight seven seven after
that the hatreds between north and south rapidly diminished until by one nine zero zero the nation was no longer divided by the war though it did remain divided by race ghosts of the conflict still persist in america for decades after the war northern politicians waved the bloody shirt bringing up memories of
the civil war as an electoral tactic while the solid south as a block in national politics was built on memories of the war and a determination to maintain segregation the civil
rights movement of the one nine six zero s had its neoabolitionist roots in the failure of reconstruction a few debates surrounding the legacy of the war continue especially regarding memorials and celebrations of confederate heroes
and battle flags the question is a deep and troubling one americans with confederate ancestors cherish the memory of their bravery and determination yet their cause remains one ultimately tied to the shameful history of african american slavery further reading overviews beringer richard e archer jones and herman hattaway why the south lost the civil war one nine eight six analysis of factors catton bruce the civil war american heritage one nine six zero isbn zero eight two eight one zero three zero five four illustrated narrative donald david ed why the north won the civil war

nine eight seven was an american painter filmmaker publisher actor and a major figure in the pop art movement biography warhol was born as andrew warhola in forest city pennsylvania his parents ondrej andrew warhola and julia zavacky were working class immigrants of ruthenian ethnicity from mikova in northeast slovakia his father worked in the coal mines of pennsylvania the family was catholic but warhol s mother had a jewish grandmother warhol showed early artistic talent and studied commercial art at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh in one
nine four nine he moved to new york city and began a
successful career in magazine illustration and advertising he became well known mainly for his whimsical ink drawings of shoes done in a loose blotted style in the one nine six zero s warhol began to make paintings of
famous american products such as campbell s soup cans and coca cola he switched to silkscreen prints seeking not only to make art of mass produced items but to mass produce the art itself he said that he wanted to be like a robot he hired and supervised art workers engaged in making prints shoes films books and other items at his studio the factory located on union square in new york city warhol s body of work furthermore includes commissioned portraits and commercials a lot of warhol
s works revolve around the concept of americana and american culture he painted money dollar signs food groceries women s shoes celebrities and newspaper clippings to him these subjects represented american cultural values for instance coca cola represents democratic equality because what s great about this country is that america started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest you can be watching
tv and see coca cola and you know that the president drinks coke liz taylor drinks coke and just think you can drink coke too a coke is a coke and no amount of money can get you a better coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking all the cokes are
the same and all the cokes are good liz taylor knows it the president knows it the bum knows it and
you know it he used popular imagery and methods to visualize the american cultural identity of the two zero
th century this popular redefinition of american culture is a theme and result of warhol s art because american culture has had great international influence warhol did
as well outside of the art world andy warhol is best known
for saying that in the future everyone will be world famous for one five minutes he later told reporters humorously my new line is in fifteen minutes
everybody will be famous socialite and recluse warhol used to socialize at serendipity and studio five four nightclubs in new york city warhol was generally regarded as quiet shy and as a meticulous observer more than one person jokingly referred to him as death warmed over warhol was openly gay rare for celebrities of his stature at the time many people think of warhol as asexual and as merely a voyeur but these notions have been debunked by biographers like fred guiles scholars e g richard meyer personal accounts of relationships by
ex lovers such as jed johnson and billy name and by the overtly campy and homoerotic nature of his work itself throughout his career warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes many of his most famous works portraits of liza minelli judy garland elizabeth taylor and
films like my hustler blow job and lonesome cowboys draw from gay underground culture and or openly explore the
complexity of sexuality and desire in fact many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters the first works that he submitted to a gallery in the pursuit of a career as an artist were in fact homoerotic drawings of male nudes they were rejected for being too openly gay
a meticulous collector he organized almost every piece of paper fan mail after taking off the stamps and magazine related to his fame along with personal notes gay pornography and found artifacts into hundreds of numbered boxes and set them aside never to open them again warhol referred to these boxes as his time capsule many exist today and are available for research at his pittsburgh museum warhol s house was filled to the brim with his collected art artifacts and americana many of his later commissioned
portraits were a direct or indirect result of this networking as a famous artist warhol and his factory attracted and facilitated many groupies and friends that warhol would include in films and happenings warhol promoted these factory
regulars to fame creating the warhol superstars they would appear in and help him make his work play in his movies write his books hang out and generally become his following when warhol was asked to give a series of university lectures that he didn t feel like doing one of his friends put on a wig and white make up and pretended to be him by sitting quietly on the stage other
superstars explained warhol s work to the audience and urged them to drop out of college the university eventually found out warhol s fraud and the following dispute had to be settled with a refund warhol would regularly volunteer at the homeless shelters in new york particularly during the busier times of the year he described himself as a religious person although not fully accepted by religion because of his homosexuality many of his later works contain almost hidden religious themes or subjects and a body of religious themed works was found posthumously in
his estate shooting on june three one nine six eight valerie solanas a factory regular entered warhol s studio and fired three shots at warhol nearly killing him although the first two rounds missed the third passed through warhol s left lung spleen stomach liver esophagus and right lung solanas then turned the gun on a companion of warhol mario amaya injuring his thigh warhol survived his injuries
but he never fully recovered earlier solanas had given a script to warhol in hopes that he would make a film out of it warhol never did apparently she had visited the factory earlier in the day to ask that they give the script back to her it had however been lost she later explained that she had attacked warhol because he had too much control over her life the story of valerie solanas was
made into the one nine nine six film i shot andy warhol starring lili taylor and directed by mary harron in the hospital his doctors had already declared him deceased after which he was resuscitated warhol later joked that he was now invulnerable since he had gone through death and came out alive the shooting and warhol s death received wide media coverage one of warhol s associates paul morrissey later satirized the
event in his movie women in revolt calling a group similar to solanas s c u m society for cutting up men p i g politically involved girls in one nine nine zero lou reed recorded the album songs for drella one of warhol s nicknames was drella a combination of dracula and cinderella with fellow velvet underground alumnus john cale warhol had adopted reed s band the velvet underground as one of his projects in the one nine
six zero s producing their first album the velvet underground and nico as well as providing the album art widely regarded as some of the greatest album art of all time the album itself is also regarded as one
of the greatest and most influential albums in rock history after the band became successful warhol and band leader reed started to disagree more and more about the direction the
band should take and the contact between them faded on the album reed apologizes and comes to terms with his part in their conflict death warhol died in new york city following routine gallbladder surgery at the age of five eight warhol was afraid of hospitals and doctors so he had delayed having his recurring gall bladder problems checked he is interred at
st john the baptist catholic cemetery in bethel park south of pittsburgh fellow artist yoko ono was among the speakers at his funeral andy warhol
had so many posessions it took sotheby s nine days to auction his estate after his death for a total gross amount of over two zero zero zero zero zero zero zero usd work paintings when he decided to pursue a career as an artist warhol had already established a reputation as a commercial illustrator in school he had made paintings but his work afterwards had mainly consisted of blotted ink illustrations for warehouses and magazines he felt that he was not being taken seriously as an illustrator and
wanted to become a real artist when he started painting he looked to find a niche for himself at that time pop art as it was later to be called was already
experimented with by several artists turning away from abstract expressionism and warhol turned to
this new way of making art where popular subjects could be part of the artist s vocabulary his early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements in a hand painted style with paint drips he added these drips to give his paintings a serious feel to emulate a bit of the style of the abstract expressionists that were en vogue at the time in other words to be
taken seriously or to sell his paintings which may have had the same meaning to warhol to warhol part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter cartoons were already being done by roy liechtenstein typography by jasper johns et cetera warhol wanted a distinguishing subject his friends suggested that he should paint the things he loved the most in his signature way of taking things literally for his first major exhibition he painted his famous cans of campbell s soup that he had for lunch most of his life warhol loved money so he later painted
money he loved celebrities so he painted them as well from these beginnings he
developed his later style and themes instead of working on a signature subject matter as he started out to do he worked more and more on a signature style slowly eliminating the hand made from the artistic process warhol went from painting to silk screening his later drawings were traced from slide projections in other words warhol went from being a painter to being a designer of paintings at the height of his
fame as a painter warhol had several assistants who produced his silk screen multiples in different versions and variations after his directions it has been suggested by many that warhol would just take images of things that were hip in his time and cover them in warhol gravy but for warhol there was always a personal relation between him and
his subjects for instance the campbell s soup did not only function as an illustration of commercial industry and advertisement it was an intrinsical part of warhol
s life and memories as a child his mother had given him this soup when he was sick and warhol loved it very much as a grown up for him and many other americans the soup represented a feeling of being home another criterion that is important in the way warhol chose his subjects is that the subjects should also represent a more philosophical notion should
have a metaphorical quality when warhol paints money he paints it because he wants to own it canvases filled with money partly his work was meant to provide him with this money and success and fame and maybe even love at the same time these paintings speak of art as a commercial commodity the paintings of dollar bills represent monetary value as well as investments in this way instead of merely depicting dollar bills these paintings touch on notions like artistic value or may be perceived as a comment on art practice similarly when warhol paints photographs of disasters
in bright colors red car crash purple jumping man orange disaster they point at the horror of the event in the picture and its media value but also at the way in which these images are trivialized by the media by turning these random clippings into paintings warhol turns them into monuments for personal tragedies as such they represent a personal experience as well as a social comment as well as an illustration
of a time when the media grew to be more and more important on a personal level a lot of warhol s work is motivational in nature
and speaks of notions like democracy being able to change things optimistic materialism being heard but warhol wasn t naively optimistic about these things his work also deals with loss death loneliness and the such warhol knew how to juggle many levels of meaning and interpretation and to combine these in seemingly simple sometimes even dumb looking
works of art in general his work has a very high duh level although
a bit of a generalization it may be accurate to say that warhol depicted highly his very personal approach to subjects that everyone knows in a way that these subjects become symbolic warhol s work became more and more conceptual and
more reflective of art itself his series of do it yourself paintings and rorschach blots are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be his cow wallpaper literally wallpaper with a cow motif and his oxidation paintings canvases prepared with copper paint that show oxidated urine stains are also noteworthy in this context warhol later did a series of his old works in negative as a comment on his own position
as an artist in the beginning of his career warhol worked on a growing oeuvre of american forms and values newspaper clippings disasters money commercial products coca cola bottles postal stamps movie stars criminals shoes clothes etc defining a position researching and making statements as recognition and the value of his work grew he went
back to his roots as a commercial illustrator and starts to take commissions most noticeably for portraits these are sometimes viewed as warhol s sell out the revolutionary painter that became a jester but it can also be
argued that his self supporting way of working fit his world views at any rate his body of portraits that include many
celebrities athletes movie stars politicians dictators royalty his mother transvestites have became a document of an era having the money or the relations to be portrayed by warhol meant that you might be able to enter into immortality warhol s commercial effort also include advertisements for chanel apple and more there are three more periods that are noteworthy in warhol s oeuvre as a painter his self portraits of which he made many with his silver
wig painted over with camouflage print may represent warhol studying his own identity warhol has spoken about himself and was spoken about as being empty hollow a reflection or a mirror the second series is his paintings of shadows these may represent
warhol s study of the abstract again there is a relation with warhol personally as he has also depicted himself as the shadow the character from the radio show thirdly warhol produced many portfolios series of small paintings meant for commercial sale these series would be grouped around a theme for instance famous jews cars or animals at one point warhol publicly declared that he had stopped being a painter and that he would only make films from then on but at the end of his life warhol took up painting again his last paintings and
drawings are of da vinci s last supper which he was working on when he died films warhol worked across a wide range of mediums painting photography drawing and sculpture he was also a highly prolific filmmaker between one nine six three and one nine six eight he made more than sixty films one of his most famous films sleep one nine six three shows a man john giorno who had a relationship with warhol sleeping for eight hours in the three five minute film blow job one nine six three he shows the face of david pelman receiving fellatio

visionairy outsiders commenting on the normal part of society but never really being a part of it and receiving appreciation for that position on basis of their idealism rare talents and personalities warhol and other pop artists helped redefine the artist s position as professional commercial

s most wanted was ice cube s debut solo album after his acrimonious split from n w a it was originally released may one six one nine nine zero see one nine nine zero in
music the title of the album is controversial it is a spoof of a television show called america s most wanted wherein real life crimes are reenacted and viewers are asked to call in if they have seen the alleged perpetrators the show has taken some criticism for the reenactments which critics claim perpetuate beliefs in the criminality
of african american men and other minorities the political spelling of america with kkk equates both the show and the status quo of society in the united states with the ku klux klan a white supremacist
organization amerikkka s most wanted is a gangsta rap album and the songs are tales of a young black man living in the ghetto and dealing with such issues as drug addiction racism and poverty to understand the album s statement it is important to note the environment of los angeles in the early one nine nine zero s riots would rack the city following the rodney king verdict seen by many including ice cube as an example of the racism inherent
in the judicial and law enforcement systems also the o j simpson trial would provoke further racial tension in the country especially los angeles unlike
many other albums from the same period cube did not allow the subject matter to infuse the album with inherent negativity he attacks perceived racist social structures far more than many gangsta rappers were doing at the time and since though he describes with detail the conditions of the ghetto he does so in order to condemn those that allow ghetto despair to occur instead
of glorifying it cube takes some controversial stands referring to certain types of african americans as oreo cookies implying that they appear to be black but are actually willing participants in the racial hierarchy that keeps the majority of african americans living in poverty stricken and drug riddled ghettos specifically this is aimed at soft pop r sell out the titular song on the album directly parodies the television
show america s most wanted exposing the perceived racism inherent in watching largely african american men being arrested for entertainment i think back to when i was robbin my own kind the police didn t pay it
no mind but when i start robbin the white folks now i m in the pen with the soap on a rope a later song get off my dick nigga and tell yo bitch to come here returns to the same theme at the end with newscaster peter jennings reporting on rioting outside the south central area few cared about the violence because it didn t affect them also of interest is it s a man s world a rap conversation with yo yo the two verbally spar
and trade sexist barbs back and forth outside of this song the album received criticism for alleged sexism as
in you can t fade me a humorous track where cube fantasizes about kicking a former one night stand in the stomach because she is pregnant with his baby nigga you love to hate is also notable for a chorus chanting fuck you
ice cube setting the tone for the album and introducing a pattern of obscenity and profanity produced by the bomb squad public enemy and da lench mob amerikkka s most wanted received accolades for innovation in production upon release however many critics
do not feel that the beats in the album have aged very well since this time west coast rap has largely taken a different direction from ice cube s style heading more towards the smooth drawl of dr dre and snoop dogg this album sounds dated as a result before striking out on his own ice cube
was a member of the legendary west coast rap group n w a straight outta compton one nine eight nine thus ice cube s lyrical style is descended
from west coast rappers like ice t iceberg freedom of speech just watch what you say one nine eight nine and too hort life is too hort musically public enemy yo bum rush the show one nine eight seven s spare hollow beats old school rappers like eric b gap band the gap band ii and soul sly
curtis mayfield let s do it again one nine seven five influenced ice cube s sound partially through his producers the bomb squad ice cube influenced later west coast rappers including the stoned drawl of cypress hill cypress hill one nine nine one and the pharcyde bizarre ride ii to the pharcyde one nine nine two as
well as later g funk rappers like dr dre the chronic one nine nine two and snoop doggy dogg doggystyle one nine nine three though ice cube s popularity among mainstream listeners has not continued into the late one nine nine zero s and his sound is distinctively old school to modern ears many rappers themselves have been influenced by his innovative lyrical techniques rappers like eminem the slim shady lp one nine nine nine nas illmatic one nine nine four and tupac shakur two pacalypse
now one nine nine two similarly use cartoonish and unrealistic images of thug violence to protest the conditions of the poor and working
class while ice cube most often described true circumstances in outlandish fashion such as a fairy tale in a gangsta s fairytale later rappers took this to the extreme of describing physically impossible acts of violence in an outrageously exaggerated manner the album spawned the hit single soulful and depressing dead homiez on the charts track listing better off dead brian holt ice cube the nigga ya love to hate ice cube e sadler amerikkka s most

when he embraced islam and on account of his military prowess and personal valor and fighting skills he obtained
the surname alp arslan which signifies a valiant lion he succeeded his father da ud as ruler of khorasan in one zero five nine and his uncle to r l as sultan of iran and
baghdad in one zero six three and thus became sole monarch of persia
from the river oxus to the tigris in consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by nizam ul mulk his persian vizier and one of the most eminent statesmen in early muslim history with peace and security established in his dominions he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son malik shah i his heir and successor with the hope of acquiring immense booty in the rich church of st basil in caesarea mazaca the capital of cappadocia he placed himself at the
head of the turkish cavalry crossed the euphrates and entered and plundered that city he then marched into armenia and georgia which he conquered in one zero six four byzantine struggle in one zero six eight alp arslan invaded the byzantine empire the emperor
romanus iv diogenes assuming the command in person met the invaders in cilicia in
three arduous campaigns the first two of which were conducted by the emperor himself while the third was directed by manuel comnenus great uncle of emperor manuel comnenus the turks were defeated in detail in one zero seven zero driven across the euphrates in one zero seven one romanus again took
the field and advanced with one zero zero zero zero zero men including a contingent of the turkish tribe of the uzes as well as contingents of french and normans under ursel of bahol into armenia at manzikert on the murad tchai north of lake van he was met by alp arslan
the sultan proposed terms of peace which were rejected by the emperor and the two forces met in the battle of manzikert in which the byzantines after a terrible slaughter were totally routed a result due mainly to the betrayal of romanus by his political enemies during the battle and the rapid tactics
of the turkish cavalry emperor romanus iv was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of alp arslan who treated him with generosity and terms of peace having been agreed to dismissed him loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard this famous conversation is recorded to have taken place after romanus iv was brought as a prisoner before the sultan alp arslan what would you do if i was brought before you as a prisoner romanus perhaps i d kill you or exhibit
you in the streets of constantinople alp arslan my punishment is far heavier i forgive you and set you free unfortunately for romanus the emperor s subjects were far less kind than his enemy making the mercy of alp arlsan a curse romanus was blinded and finally killed after great torment after alp arslan s victories the balance in the near asia changed completely in favour of seljuk turks and sunni muslims while the byzantine empire was to
continue for nearly another four centuries and the crusades would contest the issue for some time their victory at manzikert signalled the beginning of turkish ascendancy in the middle east most historians including edward gibbons date the defeat at manzikert as the beginning of the end of the eastern roman empire certainly the entry of turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in anatolia which had
furnished the empire with men and treasure the importance of this battle and the skill of alp arslan in fighting it cannot be overstated state organization alp arslan s strength lay in the military realm domestic affairs being handled by his persian vizier nizam al mulk founder of the administrative organization which characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of alp arslan and his son
malik shah military fiefs governed by seljuk princes were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic turks to the established persian agricultural scene this type of military fiefdom enabled
the nomadic turks to draw on the resources of the sedantary persians and other established cultures within the seljuk realm and allowed alp arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiery he not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars death the dominion of alp arslan after manzikert extended over much of western asia he soon prepared to march to the conquest of turkestan the original seat of his
ancestors with a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the oxus before he could pass the river with safety however it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor yussuf el harezmi a khwarezmian he was however obliged to surrender and was carried a prisoner before the sultan who condemned him to a cruel death yussuf in desperation drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan alp arslan motioned to his guards not to interfere
and drew his bow but his foot slipped the arrow glanced aside and he received the assassin s dagger in his breast alp arslan died four days later from this wound on november two five one zero seven two in his four two nd year and was taken to merv to be buried next to his father a r bey upon his tomb lies the following inscription o those who saw the sky high grandeur of alp arslan behold he is
under the black soil now as he lay dying alp arslan whispered to his son that his vanity had killed him alas he is recorded to have said surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause guarded night and day by them i should have allowed them to do their job i had been warned against trying to protect myself and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense i forgot those warnings and here i lay dying in agony remember well the lessons learned and do not allow your vanity to overreach

producer reflects the personal vision and preoccupations of that director
as if he or she were the work s primary author auteur the auteur theory has had a major impact on film criticism worldwide ever since it was first advocated by fran ois truffaut in one nine five four auteurism is the method of analyzing films based on this theory
or alternately the characteristics of a director s work that makes him an auteur both the auteur theory and the auteurism method of film analysis are frequently associated with the french new wave and the film critics who wrote for the cahiers du cin ma for a list of directors who are considered auteurs go to the article auteur notoc truffaut s theory in his one nine five four essay une certaine tendance du cin ma fran ais a certain tendency in the french cinema fran ois truffaut coined the
phrase la politique des auteurs and asserted that the worst of jean renoir s movies would always be more interesting than the best of jean delannoy s politique might very well be translated as policy polemic or program it involves a conscious decision to look at movies and to value them in a certain way truffaut provocatively said there are no good and
bad movies only good and bad directors much of truffaut s writing
of this period as too that of his colleagues at the film criticism magazine cahiers du cin ma was designed to lambast post war french cinema and especially the big production films of the cin ma de qualit quality films that truffaut s circle referred to with disdain as cin ma de papa or dad s cinema their sudden discovery of a host of great american movies which flooded france at the end of the war the nazi occupation had prevented the french from seeing such classics as the maltese falcon and citizen kane incited truffaut to take
up arms against what he considered to be an old fashioned and sterile cinema one of the unfortunate ironies of the auteur theory is that at the very moment truffaut was writing the hollywood studio system of the one nine five zero s had destroyed much of what he had
appreciated truffaut s thinking was indebted to the work of andr
bazin co founder of the cahiers du cin ma where truffaut worked who promoted the idea that films should reflect a director s personal vision and who championed such filmmakers as howard hawks alfred hitchcock and jean renoir although bazin provided a forum for auteurism to flourish he himself remained wary of its excesses another key element
of truffaut s theory comes from alexandre astruc s notion of the cam ra stylo or camera pen and the idea that directors should wield their cameras like writers use their pens and that
they need not be hindered by traditional storytelling truffaut and the members of the cahiers recognized that moviemaking was an industrial process however they proposed an ideal to strive for
the director should use the commercial apparatus the way a writer uses a pen and through the mise en sc ne imprint his or her vision on the work conversely the role of the screenwriter was minimized in their eyes while recognizing that not all directors reached this ideal they valued the work of those who neared it truffaut s theory maintains that all good directors and many bad ones have such a distinctive style or consistent theme that their influence is unmistakable in the body of their work truffaut himself was appreciative of both directors
with a marked visual style such as alfred hitchcock and those whose visual style was less pronounced but who had nevertheless a consistent theme throughout their movies such as jean renoir s humanism impact of the auteur theory
the auteur theory was used by the directors of the nouvelle vague new wave movement of french cinema in the one nine six zero s many of whom were also critics at the cahiers du cin ma as justification for their intensely personal and idiosyncratic films the
approach soon found a home in english language film criticism in the u k movie adopted auteurism and in the u s andrew sarris introduced it in the essay notes on the auteur theory in one nine six two this essay is where the half french half english term auteur theory originated to be classified as an
auteur according to sarris a director must accomplish technical competence in his or
her technique personal style in terms of how the movie looks and feels and interior meaning although many of sarris s auterist criteria were left vague later in the decade sarris published the american cinema directors and directions one nine two nine one nine six eight which quickly became the unofficial bible of auteurism the auteurist critics truffaut godard chabrol rohmer wrote mostly about directors as they were directors themselves although they also produced some shrewd appreciations of actors later writers of the same general school have emphasized the contributions of star personalities like mae west however
the stress was on directors and screenwriters producers and others have reacted with a good deal of hostility writer william goldman has said that on first hearing the auteur theory his reaction was what s the punchline criticism of the auteur theory starting in the one nine six zero s there has been a backlash against the auteur theory pauline kael
and sarris feuded in the pages of the new yorker and various film magazines one reason for the backlash is the collaborative aspect of shooting a film one person cannot do everything and in the theory s privileging of the role of the director whose name at times has become more important than the movie itself in kael s review of citizen kane a classic film for the auteur model she points out how the film involved the
talents of co writer herman j mankiewicz and cinematographer gregg toland and would have been hurt without their distinctive ability also the very people who championed the auteur theory backed away from it godard handed over much creative control to others most notably jean pierre gorin in his later films while in a twist of irony truffaut s later films embraced the same formalism he rejected early on in his career also with costly films like michael cimino s
heaven s gate the excesses of auteurism not only created uncreative films they put studios out of business however even with the reevaulation of auteurism the auteur theory continues to influence new filmmakers to this day see also mise en sc ne external links an auteurist film discussion group film theory akira kurosawa kurosawa akira also in shinjitai two three
march one nine one zero six september one nine nine eight was a prominent japanese film director film producer
and screenwriter few filmmakers have had a career so long or so acclaimed as akira kurosawa perhaps japan s best known filmmaker his films greatly influenced an entire generation of filmmakers the world over ranging from george lucas to sergio leone his first credited film sugata sanshiro was released in one nine four three his
last madadayo in one nine nine three his many awards include the legion d honneur and an oscar for lifetime achievement early career kurosawa was born in omori tokyo the youngest of seven children he trained as a painter and began work in the film industry as an assistant director to kajiro yamamoto in one nine three
six he made his directorial debut in one nine four three with sugata
sanshiro his first few films were made under the watchful eye of the wartime japanese government and sometimes contained nationalistic themes for instance the most beautiful is a
propaganda film about japanese women working in an armaments factory judo saga two has been held to be explicitly anti american in the way that it portrays japanese judo as superior to western american boxing his first post war film no regrets for our youth by contrast is critical of the old japanese regime and
is about the wife of a left wing dissident arrested for his political leanings kurosawa made several more films which deal with contemporary japan most notably drunken angel
and stray dog however it was a period film rashomon which made him internationally famous and won the
grand prix at the venice film festival characteristics kurosawa is best known for his period pieces or like seven samurai and ran but several of his films dealt with contemporary japan for example stray dog which looks at the criminal underworld just after the end of the war and ikiru which deals with a japanese bureaucrat who discovers that he is suffering from cancer but eventually steps out of depression and struggles against bureacratic inertia to leave his small contribution to the world in the
form of a small community park before he dies kurosawa had a distinctive cinematic technique which he had developed by the one nine five zero s and which gave his films a unique look he liked using telephoto lenses for the way they flattened the frame and also because he believed that placing cameras farther away from his actors produced better performances
he also liked using multiple cameras which allowed him to shoot an action from different angles another kurosawa trademark was the use of weather elements to heighten mood for example the heavy rain in the final battle in seven samurai and the fog in throne of blood kurosawa also liked using left to right frame wipes as a transition device he was known as tenno literally emperor for his dictatorial directing style he was a perfectionist who spent enormous amounts of time and effort to achieve the desired visual effects in rashomon he
dyed the rain water black with calligraphy ink in order to achieve the effect of heavy rain
and ended up using up the entire local water supply of the location area in creating the rainstorm in throne of blood in the final scene in which mifune is shot by arrows kurosawa used real arrows shot by expert archers from a short range landing within centimetres of mifune s body other stories include demanding a stream be made to run in the opposite direction in order to get a better visual effect and having the roof of a house removed
later to be replaced because he felt the roof s presence to be unattractive in a short sequence filmed from a train influences a notable feature of kurosawa s films is the breadth of his artistic influences some of his plots are adaptations of william shakespeare s works the bad sleep well is based on hamlet ran is based on king lear and throne of blood is based on macbeth kurosawa also directed film adaptations of russian novels including the idiot by dostoevsky and the lower depths by maxim gorky ikiru was based on leo tolstoy s the
death of ivan ilyich high and low was based on king s ransom by american crime writer ed mcbain stray dog was inspired by the detective novels of georges simenon the american film director john ford also had a large influence on his work despite criticism by some japanese critics that kurosawa was too western he was deeply influenced by japanese culture as well including the kabuki and noh theaters and the jidaigeki period drama genre of
japanese cinema his influence kurosawa s films had a huge influence on world cinema most
explicitly seven samurai was remade as the western the magnificent seven science fiction movie battle beyond the stars and pixar s a bug s life it also inspired two hindi films ramesh sippy s sholay and rajkumar santhoshi s china gate with similar plots the story has also inspired novels among them stephen king s fifth dark tower novel wolves of the calla yojimbo was the basis for the
sergio leone western a fistful of dollars the coen brothers film miller s crossing and the bruce willis prohibition era last man standing the hidden fortress had an influence on george lucas s earliest star wars film especially in the characters of r two d two and c three
po rashomon not only helped open japanese cinema to the world but virtually entered the english language as a term for fractured inconsistent narratives as well as influencing other works including episodes of television series and many motion pictures collaboration during his most productive period from the late four zero s to the mid six zero s kurosawa often worked with the same group of collaborators fumio hayasaka composed music for seven of his films notably rashomon ikiru and seven samurai many of kurosawa s scripts including
throne of blood seven samurai and ran were co written with hideo oguni yoshiro muraki was kurosawa s production designer or art director for most of his films after stray dog
in one nine four nine and asakazu naki was his cinematographer on one one films including ikiru seven samurai and ran kurosawa also liked recycling the same group of actors
especially takashi shimura and toshiro mifune his collaboration with the latter is one of the greatest director actor combinations in cinema history it began with one nine four eight s drunken angel and ended with one nine six four s red beard later films red beard marked a turning point in kurosawa s career in more ways than one in addition to being his last film with mifune it was his last in black and white
it was also his last as a major director within the japanese studio system making roughly a film a year kurosawa was signed to direct a hollywood project tora tora tora but two zero th century fox replaced him with kinji fukasaku before it was completed his next few films were a lot harder to finance and were made at
intervals of five years the first dodesukaden about a group of poor people living around a rubbish dump was not a success after an attempted suicide kurosawa went on to make several more films although arranging domestic financing was highly difficult despite his international reputation dersu uzala made in the soviet union and set in siberia in the early two zero th century was the only kurosawa film made outside japan and not in japanese it is about the
friendship of a russian explorer and a nomadic hunter it won the oscar for best foreign language film kagemusha financed with the help of the director s most famous admirers george lucas and francis ford coppola is the story of a man who is
the double of a medieval japanese lord and takes over his identity most important was ran kurosawa
s version of king lear set in medieval japan it was the great project of kurosawa s late career and he spent a decade planning it and trying to obtain funding which he was finally able to do with the help of the french producer
serge silberman the film was a phenomenal international success and is generally considered kurosawa s last masterpiece kurosawa made three more films during the one nine nine zero s which were more personal than his earlier works dreams is a series of vignettes based on his own dreams rhapsody in august is about memories of the nagasaki atom bomb and his final film madadayo is about a retired teacher and his former students kurosawa died in setagaya tokyo at age eight eight trivia kurosawa was a notoriously

a southerly point to the mediterranean the nile river around which much of the population of the country clusters has been the lifeline for egyptian culture since the stone age and naqada cultures the area around the nile was called kemet the black land in ancient egyptian kmt the name for the dark soil deposited by the nile floodwaters in contrast the desert was

building construction had appeared in the nile valley people many theories have been proposed regarding the origins of early egyptians a subject still imbued with controversy today controversy over race of ancient egyptians has more information about this subject egyptian society was a merging of north and northeast african
as well as southwest asian peoples modern genetics reveals that the egyptian population today is characterized by paternal lineages common to north africans primarily and to some near eastern peoples studies based on the maternal lineages closely links modern egyptians with people from modern ethiopia the ancient egyptians themselves traced their
origin to a land they called punt or ta nteru land of the gods which most egyptologists locate in the area encompassing the ethiopian highlands a recent bioanthropological study on the dental morphology of ancient egyptians confirms dental traits most characteristic of north african and to a
lesser extent southwest asian populations the study also establishes biological continuity from the predynastic to the post pharaonic periods among the samples included is skeletal material from the hawara tombs of fayum which was found to most closely resemble the badarian series of the predynastic a study based on stature and body proportions
suggests that nilotic or tropical body characteristics were also present in some later groups as the egyptian empire expanded southward champollion the younger who deciphered the rosetta stone claimed in expressions et termes particuliers

this time variously held to begin with the naqada culture some authorities however begin the predynastic period earlier in the lower paleolithic see predynastic egypt egypt unified as a single state circa three zero zero zero bc egyptian chronology involves assigning beginnings and endings to various dynasties beginning around this time the conventional egyptian chronology is the accepted developments during the two zero th century but do not include any of the major revision proposals that have also been made in that time even within a single work often archeologists will offer
several possible dates or even several whole chronologies as possibilities
consequently there may be discrepancies between dates shown here and in articles on particular rulers often there are also several possible spellings of the names typically egyptologists divide the history of pharaonic civilization using a schedule laid out first by manetho s aegyptaica list of pharaohs the pharaohs stretch from before three zero zero zero bc to around three zero bc dynasties see also list of egyptian dynasties early dynastic period of egypt one st to two nd dynasties until ca two seven th century bc old kingdom three rd to six th

and the ebers papyrus and poetic texts praising a god or a pharaoh like the hymn to the nile the egyptian vernacular already began to change from the written language as evidenced by some middle kingdom hieratic texts but classical middle egyptian continued to be written in formal contexts well into the late dynastic period sometimes referred to as late middle egyptian late egyptian one three zero zero seven

before the protodynastic period the art and science of engineering was present in egypt such as accurately determining the position of points and the distances between them known as surveying these skills were used to outline pyramid bases the egyptian pyramids took the geometric shape formed from a polygonal base and a point called the apex by triangular faces hydraulic cement was first invented by the egyptians the al fayyum irrigation water works was one of the main agricultural breadbaskets of the ancient world there is evidence of ancient egyptian pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty
using the natural lake of the fayyum as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons from the time of the first dynasty or before the egyptians mined turquoise in sinai peninsula the earliest evidence circa one six zero zero bc of traditional empiricism is credited to egypt as evidenced by the
edwin smith and ebers papyri the roots of the scientific method may be traced back to the ancient egyptians the ancient egyptians are also credited with devising the world s earliest known alphabet decimal system and complex mathematical formularizations in the form of the moscow and rhind mathematical papyri an awareness of the golden ratio
seems to be reflected in many constructions such as the egyptian pyramids the art of glass making is of very ancient origin with the egyptians as is evident from the glass jars figures and ornaments discovered in the tombs the paintings on the tombs have been interpreted as descriptive of the process of glass blowing these illustrations representing smiths blowing their fires by means of reeds tipped with

disease progressive muscular atrophy pma spinal muscular atrophy sma progressive or pseudo
bulbar palsy pbp and primary lateral sclerosis pls are all forms of motor neurone disease terminology in this article mnd refers to a group of diseases which affect the motor neurons in the united states the term als is more commonly used where it is also known as lou gehrig s disease after the baseball player although previously described by other neurologists of the one nine th century it was jean martin
charcot a french neurologist who suggested grouping together a number of disparate conditions all affecting the lateral horn of the spinal cord in one eight six nine in france the disease is sometimes known as maladie de charcot charcot s disease although it may also be referred to by
the direct translation of als sclerose laterale amyotrophique sla to help prevent confusion the
annual scientific research conference dedicated to the study of mnd is called the international als mnd symposium signs and symptoms neurological examination presents specific signs associated with upper and lower motor neuron degeneration signs of upper motor neuron damage include spasticity brisk reflexes and the babinski sign signs of lower motor neuron damage include weakness and muscle atrophy note that every muscle group in the body requires both upper and lower motor neurons to function it is a common misconception that upper motor neurons control
the arms whilst lower motor neurons control the legs the signs described above can occur in any muscle group including the arms legs torso and bulbar region symptoms usually present between the ages of five zero seven zero and include progressive weakness muscle wasting and muscle fasciculations spasticity or stiffness in the arms and legs and overactive tendon reflexes patients may present with symptoms as diverse as a dragging foot unilateral muscle wasting in the hands or slurred speech the symptoms described
above may resemble a number of other rare diseases known as mnd mimic disorders these include but are not limited to multifocal motor neuropathy kennedy s disease hereditary spastic paraplegia spinal muscular atrophy and monomelic amyotrophy a small subset of familial mnd cases occur in children such as juvenile als madras syndrome and individuals who have inherited the als two gene however these are not typically referred to as mnd but by their specific names
diagnosis the diagnosis of mnd is a clinical one established by a neurologist on the basis of history and neurological examination there is no diagnostic test for mnd investigations such as blood tests electromyography emg magnetic resonance imaging mri and sometmies genetic testing are useful to rule out other disorders that may mimic mnd however the diagnosis of mnd remains a clinical one having excluded other diseases a relatively rapid progression of symptoms is a strong diagnostic
factor although an individual s progression may sometimes plateau it will not recover or slow down a set of diagnostic criteria called the el escorial criteria have been defined by the world
federation of neurologists for use in research particularly as inclusion exclusion criteria for clinical trials due to a lack of clincial diagnostic criteria some neurologists use the el escorial criteria during the diagnostic process although strictly speaking this is functionality creep mnd in the
presence of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration is als where the illness affects only the upper motor neurons it is pls and where it affects only the lower motor neurons it is pma progressive bulbar palsy is degneration
of the lower motor neurons innervating the bulbar region mouth face and throat whilst pseudobulbar palsy refers to degeneration of the upper motor neurons to the same region prognosis most cases of mnd progess quite quickly with noticeable decline occuring over the course of months although symptoms may present in one region they will typically spread if restricted to one side of the body they are more likely to progress to the same region on the other side of the body before progressing to a new
region after several years most patients require help to carry out activities of daily living such as self care feeding and transportation mnd is typically fatal within two five years around five zero die within one
four months of diagnosis the remaining five zero will not necessarily die within the next one four months as the distribution is significantly skewed as a rough estimate one in five patients survive for five years and one in one zero patients survive one zero years stephen hawking is a well known example of a person with mnd and has lived for more than four zero years with the disease mortality results
when the muscles that control breathing are no longer able to expel carbon dioxide one exception is pls which may last for upwards of two five years given the typical age of onset this effectively leaves most pls patients with a normal life span pls can progress to als decades later pathology causes about nine zero of cases of mnd are sporadic meaning that the patient has no family history of als and the case appears to have occurred with no known cause genetic factors are
suspected to be important in determining an individual s susceptibility to disease and there is some weak evidence to suggest that onset can be triggered by as yet unknown environmental factors see epidemiology below approximately one zero of cases are familial mnd defined either by a family history of mnd or by testing positive for a known genetic mutation associated with
the disease the following genes are known to be linked to als cu zn superoxide dismutase sod one als two nefh a small number of cases senataxin setx and vesicle associated protein b vapb of these sod one mutations account for some two zero of familial mnd cases the sod one gene codes for the enzyme superoxide dismutase a free radical scavenger that reduces the oxidative stress of cells throughout the body so far over one zero zero different mutations in the sod one
gene have been found all of which cause some form of als alsod database in north america the most commonly occurring mutation is known as a four v and occurs in up to five zero of sod one cases in people of scandinavian extraction there is a relatively benign mutation called d nine zero a which is associated with a slow progression future research is concentrating on identifying new genetic mutations and the clinical syndrome associated with them familial mnd
may also confer a higher risk of developing cognitive changes such as frontotemporal dementia or executive dysfunction see extra motor change in mnd below it is thought that sod one mutations confer a toxic gain rather than a loss of function to the enzyme sod one mutations may increase the propensity for the enzyme to form protein aggregates which are toxic to nerve cells pathophysiology skeletal muscles are innervated by a group of neurons lower
motor neurons located on the ventral surface of the spinal cord which project to the muscle cells these nerve cells are themselves innervated by the corticospinal tract or upper motor neurons that project from the motor cortex of the brain on macroscopic pathology there is a degeneration of the ventral horns of the spinal cord as well as atrophy of the
ventral roots in the brain atrophy may be present in the frontal and temporal lobes on microscopic examination neurones may show spongiosis the presence of astrocytes and a number of inclusions including characteristic skein like inclusions bunina bodies and vacuolisation there is a role in excitotoxicity and oxidative stress presumably secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction in animal models death by apoptosis has also been identified emotional lability pseudobulbar affect around a third of all mnd patients experiece labile affect also known as emotional lability pseudobulbar affect or pathological laughter and crying patients
with pseudobulbar palsy are particuarly likely to be affected as are patients with
pls extra motor change in mnd cognitive change can and does occur in between three three five zero of patients a small proportion exhibit a form of frontotemporal dementia characterised by behavioural abnormalities such

grapheme represents a consonant although vowels may be indicated by vowel marks on the basic graphemes an alphabet has basic graphemes for both consonants and vowels abjads also differ from abugidas in an abjad each basic grapheme represents only a consonant in an abugida each basic grapheme represents a syllable consisting of a consonant and a vowel the same consonant with a different vowel or with no vowel is represented by a modified or marked form of the same basic grapheme etymology the system takes its name from the first nonsense word
of the mnemonic sequence for the letters of the arabic alphabet in the older abjadi order it has been suggested that the word abjad may have earlier roots in phoenician or ugaritic history all known abjads belong to the semitic family of scripts and derive from the original northern linear abjad the reason for this is that semitic languages have a morphemic structure
which makes the denotation of vowels redundant or unnecessary in most cases impure abjads impure abjads such as arabic may have characters for some vowels as well called matres lectionis mothers of reading singular mater lectionis
or optional vowel diacritics or both however the term s originator peter t daniels
insists that it should be applied only to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators thus excluding arabic hebrew and syriac impure abjads develop when due to phonetic change a previous consonant or diphthong becomes a vowel later generations who receive their orthography without knowing that letter originally signified a consonant there understand it to mean a vowel
as it is in their spoken language they then use that letter as a vowel in other places where it was never a consonant
for example the hebrew word probably underwent the following pronunciation change the which was originally the consonant w became the vowel o later probably in the second temple period the vowel use of was expanded to places where no consonant ever existed addition of vowels many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full alphabets this
has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non semitic language the most famous case being the derivation of the greek alphabet from the phoenician abjad the greeks did not need the letters for the guttural and co articulated consonants they dropped some of them and turned others into vowels in other cases the vowel signs come in the form of little points or hooks attached to the consonant letters producing an abugida such as the system of writing amharic written using the ge ez alphabet which
was formerly an abjad before a vocalization occurred sometime after the five th century bce but before the four th century ce related concepts surprisingly many non semitic languages such as english can be written without vowels and read with little difficulty for example the previous sentence could be written srprsngly mny nn smtc lnggs sch s nglsh cn b wrttn wtht vwls nd rd wth lttl dffclty this fact can be used to semi bowdlerise offensive
language a practice known as disemvoweling some usages of one three three seven speak drop vowels especially for small words see also abjad numerals references v one p two eight external links abjad the arabic alphabet learning system writing systems an abugida alphasyllabary or syllabics is a writing system composed of signs graphemes denoting consonants with an inherent following vowel which are consistently modified to indicate other vowels or in some cases the
lack of a vowel examples include the various scripts of the brahmic family ethiopic ge ez and canadian aboriginal syllabics a typical abugida is devanagari there is no basic sign representing the consonant k rather the unmodified letter represents the syllable ka the a is the so called inherent
vowel the vowel may be changed by adding vowel marks to the basic character producing other
syllables beginning with k such as ki ku ke ko these diacritics are applied systematically to other
consonantal characters for example from la is formed li lu le lo such a consonant with either an inherent or marked vowel is called an akshara in many abugidas there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel yielding the bare consonant in devanagari is k and is l this is called the virama in sanskrit or halant in hindi it may be used to form consonant clusters or to indicate that a
consonant occurs at the end of a word other means of expressing these functions include special conjunct forms in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster such as devanagari kla note that on some fonts display this
as followed by rather than forming a conjunct the diacritics may
appear above below to the left or to the right of the consonantal character or may surround it as in tamil kau from ka in many of the brahmic scripts a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking so a vowel marker like i falling before the character it
modifies may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced for example the game cricket in hindi is krike the diacritic for i appears before the consonant cluster kr not before the r a more unusual example is seen in the batak alphabet here the syllable bim is written ba ma i virama that is the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants
for the whole syllable in ge ez the prototype abugida the form of the letter itself may be altered for example
h basic form hu with a right side diacritic that does
not alter the letter hi with a subdiacritic compresses the letter so that the whole fidel akshara occupies the same amount of space he where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm in the family of abugidas known as canadian aboriginal syllabics vowels are indicated by modification rotation and reflection of the akshara for example inuktitut pi pu pa ti tu ta the r ng script used for the lepcha language goes
further than other abugidas in that each akshara is a full syllable not only the vowel but any final consonant is
indicated by a diacritic for example the syllable sok would written as something like here with an underring representing o and an overcross representing the diacritic for final k there are several abugidas of indonesia which
also indicate final consonants with diacritics but usually these are restricted to one or two nasals such as the pahawh hmong script represents both consonants and vowels with full letters however the graphic order is vowel consonant even though they are pronounced as consonant vowel this is rather like the o vowel in the indic abugidas pahawh hmong is unusual in that while the inherent vowel au is unwritten so is the inherent consonant k for the syllable kau which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be
overt it is au that is written that is a pahawh akshara appears to be a vowel with an inherent consonant rather than the other way around it is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other segmental scrips for example the meroitic script of ancient sudan did not indicate an inherent a one symbol
stood for both m and ma for example and is thus similar to brahmic family abugidas however the other vowels were indicated with full letters not diacritics or modification so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel thaana is also like an abugida in that vowels are marked with diacritics however all vowels are marked as is the absence of a vowel there is no inherent vowel normally no letter may occur without a diacritic that is it is equivalent to an abjad with obligatory
vowel marking like the arabic alphabet as used for kurdish in iraq as is thus essentially alphabetic note that it developed among a population that was already literate with an abugida for their language several systems of shorthand use diacritics for vowels but they do not have an inherent vowel and are thus more similar to thaana and kurdish than to the brahmic scripts the pollard script which was based on shorthand also uses diacritics for vowels the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates tone as
the term alphasyllabary suggests abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between alphabets and syllabaries historically abugidas appear to have evolved from abjads vowelless alphabets they contrast with syllabaries where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant vowel combination and where these have no systematic similarity to each other compare the devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the japanese hiragana syllabary ka ki ku ke ko have nothing in common to
indicate k while ra ri ru re ro have neither anything in common for r nor anything do indicate that they have the same vowels as the k set the term abugida is taken from a conventional name for the ge ez script derived from its first four letters as ordered in some religious contexts this order corresponds to the ancestral semitic character order aleph beth gimel daleth or a b c d historically abugidas appear to have first evolved from abjads perhaps aramaic with the kharo h and br hm
scripts the kharosthi family does not survive today but brahmi s descendents include most of the modern scripts of south and southeast asia canadian syllabics was derived from devanagari and is thus in the brahmic family or was at least influenced by devanagari in its creation although ge ez derived from a different abjad its evolution into an abugida may have been due to the influence of christian missionaries from india partial list of abugidas

to slow the virus progression in a human patient there is no known cure most researchers believe that hiv originated in sub saharan africa during the twentieth century it is now a global epidemic unaids and the world health organization who estimate that aids has killed more than two five million people since it was first recognized on december one one nine eight one making it one of the most destructive pandemics in recorded history in two zero zero five alone aids claimed
between an estimated two eight and three six million of which more than five seven zero zero zero zero were children in countries where there is access to antiretroviral treatment both mortality and morbidity of hiv infection have been reduced however side effects of these antiretrovirals have
also caused problems such as lipodystrophy dyslipidaemia insulin resistance and an increase in cardiovascular risks the difficulty of consistently taking the medicines has also contributed to the rise of viral escape and resistance to the medicines the red ribbon is the global symbol for solidarity with
hiv positive people and those living with aids infection by hiv scanning electron micrograph of hiv one budding from cultured lymphocyte aids is the most severe
manifestation of infection with hiv hiv is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital components of the human immune system such as cd four t cells macrophages and dendritic cells it also directly and indirectly destroys cd four t cells as cd four t cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system when enough cd four cells have been destroyed by hiv the immune system barely works leading to aids acute hiv infection progresses over time to clinical latent hiv infection and then to early symptomatic hiv infection and
later to aids which is identified on the basis of the amount of cd four positive cells in the blood and the presence of certain infections in the absence of antiretroviral therapy progression from hiv infection to aids occurs at a median of between nine to ten years and the median survival time after developing aids is only nine two
months however the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals from two weeks up to two zero years many factors affect the rate of progression these include factors that influence the body s ability
to defend against hiv including the infected person s genetic inheritance general immune function access to health care age and other coexisting infections different strains of hiv may also cause different rates of clinical disease progression diagnosis aids and hiv case
definitions since june one eight one nine eight one many
different definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the bangui definition and the one nine nine four expanded world health organization aids case definition however these were never intended to be used for clinical staging of patients for which they are neither sensitive nor specific the world health organizations who staging system for hiv infection and disease using clinical and laboratory data can be used in developing countries and the centers for disease control cdc classification system can be used in developed nations who disease staging system for hiv infection and
disease in one nine nine zero the world health organization who grouped these infections and conditions together by introducing a staging system for patients infected with hiv one this was updated in september
two zero zero five most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that can be easily treated in healthy people stage i hiv disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as aids stage ii include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections stage iii includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month severe
bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis or stage iv includes toxoplasmosis of
the brain candidiasis of the esophagus trachea bronchi or lungs and kaposi
s sarcoma these diseases are used as indicators of aids cdc classification system for hiv infection in the usa the definition of aids is governed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in one nine nine three the cdc expanded their definition of aids to include healthy hiv positive people with a cd four positive t cell count of less than two zero zero per l of blood the majority of new aids cases in the united states are reported on the basis of a low t cell
count in the presence of hiv infection hiv test approximately half of those infected with hiv don t know that they are infected until they are diagnosed with aids hiv test kits are used to screen donor blood and blood products and to diagnose hiv in individuals typical hiv tests including the hiv enzyme immunoassay and the western blot assay detect hiv antibodies in serum plasma oral fluid dried blood spot or urine of patients other tests to look for hiv antigens hiv rna and hiv dna are also commercially
available and can be used to detect hiv infection prior to the development of detectable antibodies however these assays are not specifically approved by the u s food and drug administration for the diagnosis of hiv infection symptoms and complications a generalized graph of the relationship between hiv copies viral load and cd four counts over the
average course of untreated hiv infection any particular individuals disease course may vary considerably the symptoms of aids are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems most of these conditions are
infections caused by bacteria viruses fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that hiv damages opportunistic infections are common in people with aids nearly every organ system is affected people with aids also have an increased risk of developing various cancers such as kaposi sarcoma cervical cancer
and cancers of the immune system known as lymphomas additionally people with aids often have systemic symptoms of infection like fevers sweats
particularly at night swollen glands chills weakness and weight loss after the diagnosis of aids is made the current average survival time with antiretroviral therapy is estimated to be between four to five years but because new treatments continue to be
developed and because hiv continues to evolve resistance to treatments estimates of survival time are likely to continue to change without antiretroviral therapy progression to death normally occurs within a year most patients die from opportunistic infections or malignancies associated with the progressive failure of the immune system the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by many factors such as host susceptibility health care and
co infections and peculiarities of the viral strain also the specific opportunistic infections that aids patients develop depends in part on the prevalence of these infections in the geographic area in which the patient lives the major pulmonary illnesses pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia originally known as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia often abbreviated pcp is relatively rare in normal immunocompetent people but common among hiv infected individuals before the advent of effective treatment and diagnosis in western countries it was a common immediate cause of death in developing countries it is still
one of the first indications of aids in untested individuals although it does not generally occur unless the cd four count is less than two zero zero per l tuberculosis among infections associated with hiv
tuberculosis tb is unique in that it may be transmitted to immunocompetent persons via the respiratory route is easily treatable once identified may occur in early stage hiv disease and is preventable with drug therapy however multi drug resistance is a potentially serious problem even though its incidence has declined because of the use of directly observed therapy and
other improved practices in western countries this is not the case in developing countries where hiv is most prevalent in early stage hiv infection cd four count three zero zero cells per l tb typically presents as a pulmonary disease in advanced hiv infection tb may present atypically and extrapulmonary tb is common infecting bone marrow bone urinary and gastrointestinal tracts liver regional lymph nodes and the central nervous system the major gastro intestinal illnesses esophagitis esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of
the lower end of the esophagus gullet or swallowing tube leading to the stomach in hiv infected individuals this could be due to fungus candidiasis virus herpes simplex one or cytomegalovirus in rare cases it could be due to mycobacteria
unexplained chronic diarrhea in hiv infection there are many possible causes of diarrhea including common bacterial salmonella shigella listeria campylobacter or escherichia coli and parasitic infections and uncommon opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis microsporidiosis mycobacterium avium complex mac and cytomegalovirus cmv colitis diarrhea may follow a course of antibiotics common for clostridium difficile it may also be a side effect of several drugs used to treat hiv or it may simply
accompany hiv infection particularly during primary hiv infection in the
later stages of hiv infection diarrhea is thought to be a reflection of changes in the way the intestinal tract absorbs nutrients and may be an important component of hiv related wasting the major neurological illnesses toxoplasmosis toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the single celled parasite
called toxoplasma gondii t gondii usually infects the brain causing toxoplasma encephalitis it can also infect and cause disease in the eyes and lungs progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml is a demyelinating disease in which the myelin sheath covering the axons of nerve cells is gradually destroyed impairing the transmission of nerve impulses it is caused by a virus called jc virus which occurs in seven zero of the population in latent form causing disease only when the immune system has been severly
weakened as is the case for aids patients it progresses rapidly usually causing death within months of diagnosis hiv associated dementia hiv one associated dementia had is a metabolic encephalopathy induced by hiv infection and fueled by immune activation of brain macrophages and microglia these
cells are actively infected with hiv and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin specific neurologic impairments are manifested by cognitive behavioral and motor abnormalities that occur after years of hiv
infection and is associated with low cd four t cell levels and high plasma viral loads prevalence is between one zero two zero in western countries and has only been seen in one two of india based infections cryptococcal meningitis this infection of the meninges the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord by the fungus cryptococcus neoformans can cause fevers headache fatigue nausea and vomiting patients may also develop seizures and confusion if untreated it can be lethal the major hiv associated malignancies patients with hiv infection have substantially
increased incidence of several malignancies several of these kaposi s sarcoma high grade lymphoma and cervical cancer confer a diagnosis of aids when they occur in an hiv infected person kaposi s sarcoma kaposi s sarcoma is the most common tumor in hiv infected patients the appearance of this tumor
in young gay men in one nine eight one was one of the first signals of the aids epidemic it is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called kaposi s sarcoma associated herpes virus kshv it often appears as purplish nodules on the skin but other organs especially the mouth gastrointestinal tract and lungs can be affected high grade lymphoma several high grade b cell lymphomas have substantially increased incidence in hiv infected patients and often portend a poor prognosis the
most common aids defining lymphomas are burkitt s lymphoma burkitt s like lymphoma and diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl including primary central nervous system lymphoma primary effusion lymphoma is less common many of these lymphomas are caused by either epstein barr virus ebv or kshv cervical cancer cervical cancer in hiv infected women is also considered aids defining it is caused by human papillomavirus hpv other tumors in addition to the aids
defining tumors listed above hiv infected patients are also at increased risk of certain other tumors such as hodgkin s disease and anal and rectal carcinomas however the incidence of many common tumors such as breast cancer or colon cancer are not increased in hiv infected patients most aids associated malignancies are caused by co infection of patients with an oncogenic dna virus especially epstein barr virus ebv kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus kshv and human papillomavirus hpv in areas where haart is extensively used to treat aids the incidence of many aids
related malignancies has decreased but at the same time malignancies overall have become the most common cause of death of hiv infected patients other opportunistic infections patients with aids and severe immunosuppression often develop opportunistic infections that present with non specific symptoms especially low grade fevers and weight loss
these include infection with mycobacterium avium intracellulare and cytomegalovirus cmv cmv can also cause colitis as described above and cmv retinitis can cause blindness penicilliosis due to penicillium marneffei is now the third most common opportunistic infection after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and cryptococcosis in hiv positive individuals within the endemic area of southeast asia transmission since the beginning of the epidemic three main transmission routes of hiv have been identified sexual route the majority of hiv infections have been and still are acquired through unprotected sexual relations sexual transmission occurs when there is contact between sexual secretions of
one partner with the rectal genital or mouth mucous membranes of another blood or blood product route this transmission route is particularly important for intravenous drug users hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions and blood products health care workers nurses laboratory workers doctors etc are
also concerned although more rarely also concerned by this route are people
who give and receive tattoos and piercings mother to child route vertical transmission the transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can
occur in utero during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby in the absence of treatment the transmission rate between the mother and child was two zero however where treatment is available combined with the availability of cesarian section this has been reduced to one hiv has been found in the saliva tears and urine of infected individuals but due to the
low concentration of virus in these biological liquids the risk is considered to be negligible prevention the diverse transmission routes of hiv are well known and established also well known is how to prevent transmission of hiv however recent epidemiological and behavioral studies in europe and north america have suggested that a substantial minority of young people continue to engage in high risk practices and that despite
hiv aids knowledge young people underestimate their own risk of becoming infected with hiv however transmission of hiv between intravenous drug users has clearly decreased and hiv transmission by blood transfusion has become quite rare in developed countries prevention of sexual transmission of hiv underlying science unprotected receptive sexual acts are at more risk than unprotected insertive sexual acts with the risk for transmitting hiv from an infected partner to an uninfected partner through unprotected insertive anal intercourse greater than
the risk for transmission through vaginal intercourse or oral sex oral sex is not without its risks as it has been established that hiv can be transmitted through both insertive and receptive oral sex sexually transmitted infections sti increase the risk of hiv transmission and infection because they cause the disruption of the normal epithelial barrier by genital ulceration and or microulceration and by accumulation of
pools of hiv susceptible or hiv infected cells lymphocytes and macrophages in semen and vaginal secretions epidemiological studies from sub saharan africa europe and north america have suggested that there is approximately a four times greater risk of becoming hiv infected in the presence of a genital ulcer such
as caused by syphilis and or chancroid and a significant though lesser increased risk in the presence of stis such as gonorrhoea chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis which cause local accumulations of lymphocytes and macrophages transmission of hiv depends on the infectiousness of the index case and the susceptibility of the uninfected partner infectivity seems to vary during the course
of illness and is not constant between individuals an undetectable plasma
viral load does not mean that you have a low viral load in the seminal liquid or genital secretions each one zero fold increment of seminal hiv rna is associated with an eight
one increased rate of hiv transmission women are more susceptible to hiv one infection due to hormonal changes vaginal microbial ecology and physiology and a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted
diseases also people who are infected with hiv can still be infected by other more virulent strains prevention strategies during a sexual act only condoms be they male or female can reduce the chances of infection with hiv and other stis and the chances of becoming pregnant they must be used during all penetrative sexual intercourse with a partner who is hiv positive or whose status is unknown the effective use of condoms and screening of blood transfusion in north america western and central europe is credited with
the low rates of aids in these regions promoting condom use however has often proved controversial and difficult many religious groups most visibly the roman catholic church have opposed the use of condoms on religious grounds and have sometimes seen condom promotion as an affront to the promotion of marriage monogamy and sexual morality other religious groups have argued that preventing hiv infection is a moral task in
itself and that condoms are therefore acceptable or even praiseworthy from a religious point of view condoms in many colors the male latex condom is the single most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections in order to be effective they must be used correctly during each sexual act lubricants containing oil such as petroleum jelly or butter must not be used as they weaken latex condoms and make them porous if necessary lubricants made from water are recommended
however it is not recommended to use a lubricant for fellatio also condoms have standards and expiration dates it is essential to check the expiration date and if it conforms to european ec six zero zero or american d three four nine two standards before use the female condom is an alternative to the male condom and is made from polyurethane which allows it to be used in the presence of
oil based lubricants they are larger than male condoms and have a stiffened ring shaped opening and are designed to be inserted into the vagina the female condom also contains an inner ring which keeps the condom in place inside the vagina inserting the female condom requires squeezing this ring with consistent and correct use of condoms there is a very low risk of hiv infection studies on couples where one partner is infected show that with
consistent condom use hiv infection rates for the uninfected partner are below one per year governmental programs the u s government and u s health
organizations both endorse the abc approach to lower the risk of acquiring aids during sex a bstinence
or delay of sexual activity especially for youth b eing faithful especially for those in
committed relationships c ondom use for those who engage in risky behavior this approach has been very successful in uganda where hiv prevalence has decreased from one five to five however the abc approach is far from all that uganda has done as uganda has pioneered approaches towards reducing stigma bringing discussion of sexual behavior out into the open involving hiv infected people in public education persuading individuals and couples to be tested and counseled improving the status of women involving religious organizations enlisting traditional healers and much more edward green harvard medical
anthropologist also it must be noted that there is no conclusive proof that abstinence only programs have been successful in any country in the world in reducing hiv transmission this is why condom use is heavily co promoted there is also considerable overlap with the cnn approach this is c ondom use for those who engage in risky behavior n eedles use clean ones n egotiating skills negotiating safer sex with a partner and empowering women to make smart choices the abc approach has been criticized because a faithful partner of an unfaithful partner is at risk of aids
many think that the combination of the cnn approach with the abc approach will be
the optimum prevention platform circumcision current research is clarifying the relationship between male circumcision and hiv in differing social
and cultural contexts unaids believes that it is premature to recommend male circumcision services as part of hiv prevention programmes moreover south african medical experts are concerned that the repeated use of unsterilised blades in the ritual circumcision of adolescent boys may be spreading hiv prevention of blood or blood product route of hiv transmission underlying science sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with hiv infected blood represents a major risk for infection with not only hiv but also hepatitis b and hepatitis c in the united states a third of all new
hiv infections can be traced to needle sharing and almost five zero of long term addicts have hepatitis c the risk of being infected with hiv from a single prick with a needle that has been used on an hiv infected person though is thought to be about one in one five zero see table above post exposure prophylaxis with anti hiv drugs can further reduce that small
risk universal precautions are frequently not followed in both sub saharan africa
and much of asia because of both a shortage of supplies and inadequate training the who estimates that approximately two five of all hiv infections in sub saharan africa are transmitted through unsafe healthcare injections because of this the united nations general assembly supported by universal medical opinion on the matter has urged the nations of the world to implement universal precautions to prevent hiv transmission in health care settings prevention strategies in countries where improved
donor selection and antibody tests have been introduced the risk of transmitting hiv infection to blood transfusion recipients is extremely low but according to the who the overwhelming majority of the world s population does not have access to safe blood and between five and one zero of hiv infections worldwide are transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood products medical workers who follow universal precautions or body substance isolation such as wearing latex gloves when giving injections and washing the hands frequently can help prevent infection of hiv all aids prevention organizations advise drug users not

the higher the risk breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission by one zero one five this risk depends on clinical factors and may vary according to the pattern and duration of breastfeeding prevention strategies studies have shown that antiretroviral drugs cesarean delivery and formula feeding reduce
the chance of transmission of hiv from mother to child when replacement feeding is acceptable feasible affordable sustainable and safe hiv infected mothers are recommended to avoid breast feeding their infant otherwise exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life and should be discontinued as soon as possible treatment there is currently no cure for hiv
or aids infection with hiv usually leads to aids and ultimately death however in western countries most patients survive many years following diagnosis because of the availability of the
highly active antiretroviral therapy haart in the absence of haart progression from hiv infection to aids occurs at a median of between nine to ten years and the median survival time after developing aids is only nine two months haart dramatically increases the time from diagnosis to death and treatment research continues current optimal haart options consist of combinations or cocktails consisting of at least three drugs belonging
to at least two types or classes of anti retroviral agents typical regimens consist of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis plus either a protease inhibitor or a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti this treatment is frequently referred to as haart highly active anti retroviral therapy anti retroviral treatments along with medications intended to prevent aids related opportunistic infections have played a part in delaying complications associated with aids
reducing the symptoms of hiv infection and extending patients life spans over the past decade the success of these treatments in prolonging and improving the quality of life for people with aids has improved dramatically because hiv disease progression in children is more rapid than in adults and laboratory parameters are less predictive of risk for disease progression particularly for young infants treatment recommendations from the dhhs have been more aggressive in
children than in adults the current guidelines were published november three two zero zero five
the dhhs also recommends that doctors should assess the viral load rapidity in cd four decline and patient readiness while deciding when to recommend initiating treatment there are several concerns about antiretroviral regimens the drugs can have serious side effects regimens can be
complicated requiring patients to take several pills at various times during the day although treatment regimens have been greatly simplified in recent years if patients miss doses drug resistance can develop also anti retroviral drugs are costly and the majority of the world s infected
individuals do not have access to medications and treatments for hiv and aids research to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance a number of studies have shown that measures to prevent opportunistic infections can be beneficial when treating patients with hiv infection or
aids vaccination against hepatitis a and b is advised for patients who are not infected with these viruses and are at risk of getting infected
in addition aids patients should receive vaccination against streptococcus pneumoniae and should receive yearly vaccination against influenza virus patients with substantial immunosuppression are generally advised to receive prophylactic therapy for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia pcp and many patients may benefit from
prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus meningitis alternative medicine ever since aids entered the public consciousness various forms of alternative medicine have been used to try to treat symptoms or to try to affect the course of the disease itself in the first decade of the epidemic when no useful conventional treatment was available a large number of people with aids experimented with alternative therapies the definition of alternative therapies in aids has changed since that time during that time the phrase often referred to community driven treatments not
being tested by government or pharmaceutical company research that some hoped would directly suppress the virus or stimulate immunity against it these kinds of approaches have become less common over time as aids drugs have become more effective the phrase then and now also refers to other approaches that people hoped would improve their symptoms or their quality of
life for instance massage herbal and flower remedies and acupuncture when used with conventional treatment many now refer to these
as complementary approaches none of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating hiv or aids directly however some may improve feelings of well being in people who believe in their value additionally people with aids like
people with other illnesses such as cancer also sometimes use marijuana to treat pain combat nausea and stimulate appetite epidemiology map of africa coloured according to the percentage of the adult ages one five four nine population with hiv aids unaids and the who estimate that aids has killed more than two five million people since it was first recognized in one nine eight one making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history despite recent improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the

a one nine nine two rolling stone magazine article by freelance journalist tom curtis he put forward the theory that aids was inadvertantly caused in the late one nine five zero s in the belgian congo by hilary koprowski s research into a polio vaccine although subsequently retracted due to libel issues surrounding its claims the rolling stone article motivated
another freelance journalist edward hooper to probe more deeply into this subject hooper s research resulted in his publishing a one nine nine nine book the river in which
he alleged that an experimental oral polio vaccine prepared using chimpanzee kidney tissue was the route through which siv crossed into humans to become hiv thus starting the human aids pandemic alternative theories a minority of scientists and activists question the connection between hiv and aids or the existence of hiv or the validity of current testing methods these claims are met with resistance by and often evoke frustration and hostility from most of the scientific community who accuse the dissidents of ignoring evidence in favor of hiv s role
in aids and irresponsibly posing a dangerous threat to public health
by their continued activities dissidents assert that the current mainstream approach to aids based on hiv causation has resulted in inaccurate diagnoses psychological terror toxic

in hiv vaccine research recorded interview with prof robert gallo hiv discoverer hiv aids immune system disorders infectious diseases pandemics sexually transmitted diseases virology abba one nine seven two one nine eight three was a swedish pop music group they remain the most successful swedish music act and were one of the most popular groups in the world the group dominated charts worldwide during the mid to late one
nine seven zero s and early one nine eight zero s selling many hit singles and albums estimates of abba s total worldwide sales vary from three zero zero to four zero zero million there seems to be no reliable source for this information which could make them the second most successful band of all
time after the beatles they were the first act from the european mainland to become a regular fixture in british american and australian charts and their success subsequently opened the doors for many other european acts their lasting legacy is the legitimising of the swedish music industry as a mainstream
player abba was formed around one nine seven two with bj
rn ulvaeus benny andersson agnetha f ltskog and anni frid lyngstad nicknamed frida they became
widely known after winning the one nine seven four eurovision song contest with waterloo
the group consisted of two couples bj rn and agnetha along with benny and frida abba collectively decided to take a break at the
beginning of one nine eight three they have yet to record together again in the studio abba is an acronym formed from the first letters of each group member s name it is usually written abba but is sometimes written as a word abba the first b in the logo version of the name was reversed on the band s promotional material from one nine seven six onwards history before abba benny andersson was a member of the swedish
rock pop band hep stars who were very popular in sweden during the one nine six zero
s the band was modeled after various us and uk groups such as herman s hermits the who and the rolling stones the hep stars had a huge following especially among teenage girls meanwhile bj rn ulvaeus was fronting a skiffle group called the hootenanny singers whose sound was softer
and more easy listening than the hep stars the singers crossed paths sometimes and they decided to write songs together one of these isn t it easy to say became a hit for the hep stars and bj rn sometimes guested with the band on tour it was even suggested that the two bands merge but this never happened stig anderson
manager of the hootenanny singers and founder of polar music saw more potential in benny and
bj rn working together and encouraged them to write more songs and create an album which was eventually called lycka happiness when released on the polar label agnetha f ltskog was abba s youngest member and a pop phenomenon in her own right who wrote and performed swedish hits while in her teens and had also played mary magdalene in the swedish production of jesus christ superstar agnetha was noted by critics and songwriters as an accomplished composer but she
considered it hard work writing and performing light pop songs in the schlager style recording covers of hit songs and touring swedish folkparks the main live circuit at that time inevitably she bumped into the hootenanny singers on their folkpark tours meeting and eventually falling in love with bj rn their marriage in one nine seven one was the swedish celebrity wedding of the year and drew much publicity housewife anni frid frida lyngstad was a part time cabaret singer who decided to enter a talent competition and won sweden was
changing over from driving on the left side of the road to the right and a series of spectacular shows was being aired to encourage people to stay off the roads on the night of
the switchover invited to appear on tv that evening with her winning song frida s musical career took off she met benny andersson on the wonted folkpark tour they became lovers and benny invited anni frid to sing backing vocals with agnetha on the lycka album the two women were uncredited for this work early
years the cover of people need love the first single released by the group by the early one nine seven zero s although bj rn and agnetha were married they pursued their own separate musical careers however stig was ambitious and determined to break into the mainstream international market not something that swedish acts were usually known for though previously achieved by swedish instrumental guitar group the spotnicks their best known hit
was orange blossom special as a result he encouraged bj rn and benny to write a song for the one nine seven two eurovision song contest and it was performed by lena anderson say it with a song won third in the contest selection rounds but was a huge hit in several countries convincing stig he was on the right track bj rn and benny persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements which brought some success in japan one of the songs
they came up with was people need love featuring guest vocals by the girls who were now given much greater prominence than previously everyone involved felt enthusiastic about the new sound and stig released it as a single credited to bj rn ring ring the studio work was handled by michael b tretow who experimented with a phil spector like wall of sound production technique that became the wholly new abba sound stig arranged an
english translation of the lyrics by neil sedaka and phil cody and they thought this would be a sure fire winner yet again it came in third nevertheless the proto group put out an album called ring ring still carrying the awkward naming of bj rn benny
agnetha ring ring single was a hit in many parts of europe but stig felt the true breakthrough could only come with a uk or us hit around this time stig having tired of the unwieldy names started to refer to the group privately and publicly as abba this was done
as a joke at first since abba was also the name of a well known fish canning company in sweden however since the fish canners were more or less unknown outside sweden stig came to believe the name would work in international markets and so it stuck later the group negotiated with the canners for the right to use the name eurovision and
after waterloo one nine seven four mamma mia one nine seven five they tried eurovision again in one nine seven four now inspired by the
growing glam rock scene in the uk and tracks like wizzard s see my baby jive waterloo was an unashamedly glam style pop track produced with michael b tretow s wall of sound approach now far more experienced they were better prepared for
the contest and had an album s worth of material released when the show was held in brighton england the song won hands down and catapulted them into british consciousness for
the first time now they had a catchy name abba and people could buy the whole album waterloo straightaway waterloo was abba s first uk no one it was also released in the us reaching no six but momentum proved hard to maintain and their follow up singles so long and honey honey did not do nearly as well the group was overstretched
and unable to promote the songs convincingly in any one country moreover much of their material was still heavily derivative it wasn t until the release of their second proper album abba and their single sos that abba began to show the first signs they were destined for bigger things sos consolidated abba s presence in the uk where it was a top one zero hit and they were no
longer regarded as a one hit wonder much wider success came in one nine seven five with every release charting solidly and mamma mia reaching the uk no one spot in january one nine seven six at this time the band released the somewhat
hubristically titled greatest hits album despite having had only five
top four zero hits in the uk and the us this album included fernando an earlier version had been a swedish language hit single for anni frid and included on her one nine seven five benny produced solo lp frida ensam becoming one of abba s best known tracks fernando did not appear on the swedish or australian releases of greatest hits in sweden the song would wait until one nine eight two s the singles the first ten years to appear in an english language version credited to abba the track was later included in the australian release
of their one nine seven six album arrival the next album arrival represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work for abba hit after hit
flowed from it money money money knowing me knowing you and dancing queen their most enduring and definitive hit by this time abba were widely popular in the uk most of
western europe and australia who in a way almost adopted abba as their own but still had only moderate recognition and airplay in the us and dancing queen remains the only no one abba ever achieved there movie poster for abba the movie and
the album carried the same artwork by this time the
abba sound was synonymous with european pop and was widely copied by groups like brotherhood of man and later bucks fizz some felt it was necessary to copy abba s sound and two girl two boy approach to win eurovision and the notion seemed validated when brotherhood of man won in one nine seven six and bucks fizz took the prize in one nine eight one meanwhile in one nine seven seven abba followed up arrival with the more complex the album which was released to coincide with abba
the movie a feature film of their australian tour this album was less well received by the critics but spawned several hits the name of the game and take a chance on me both of which topped the uk charts this album also carried the well known thank you for the music that later was released in the uk as a single one
nine eight three and had been a b side of eagle in territories where that song was released as a single later years by one nine seven eight abba was a megagroup they converted a disused cinema into the polar music studio a new state of the art studio in stockholm which was used by several other successful bands led zeppelin s
in through the out door was recorded there for example their standalone single summer night city their last swedish number one stopped just short of topping the uk charts but set the stage for abba s foray into disco with the album voulez vous which was released in spring one nine seven nine this release marked a slight decline in abba s popularity in the uk and europe but gained them more attention in the us the hits still came chiquitita does your
mother know voulez vous and i have a dream all charted in january one nine seven nine the group performed at the music for unicef concert at the united nations general assembly performing chiquitita the royalties from the song were donated to unicef later that year the group released their second greatest hits album
greatest hits vol two which featured a brand new track gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight their best known disco hit in one nine seven nine abba toured the us and canada playing to huge audiences but the breakthrough there was perhaps too little too late one nine eight zero s super trouper reflected a change in abba s style with more prominent synthesisers and more personal lyrics it set a record for the most preorders ever received
for a uk album after one million copies were ordered before release anticipation for the release had been built up by the winner takes it all the group s eighth uk chart topper their first since one nine seven eight this song was allegedly written about bjorn and agnetha s marriage which was breaking down at the time the next single from the album super trouper also hit number one lay all your love on me was an album track that was released in one nine eight one as
a one two inch single only in limited territories and along with super trouper managed to top the american club and
dance chart a spanish language compilation album was also recorded at this time gracias por la musica which was released in latin america and sold very well the
visitors one nine eight one their final studio album showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placed the band squarely in the pop genre with catchy tunes and harmonies the visitors title track refers to secret meetings
held against the approval of communist governments in soviet satellite states and other tracks address topics like aging loss of innocence a parent watching her child grow up and so on their melodies were still catchy but their change of style was reflected by the start of
a commercial decline after their final great pop single one of us which was a worldwide hit in december one nine eight one although by this time regarded as a group in decline abba still drew huge audiences particularly in continental europe and might have gone on indefinitely if it were not for the band s personal turmoils the two married couples were both divorced by this point songs like the winner takes it all and one of us gave glimpses of personal issues abba s members were
facing in summer one nine eight two the group gathered to record a new album in the end they settled for a double album compilation of all their past successes with two new songs the double album the singles the first ten years
topped the uk album chart and was a worldwide bestseller the new tracks were under attack and the day before you came which was the last song abba ever recorded together two other songs were recorded during one nine eight two i am the city and just like that while both were completed only i am the city was released on the compilation album more abba gold in one nine nine three despite numerous efforts from fans bj rn ulvaeus and benny andersson are still refusing to release just like that in its entirety the group
gradually drifted apart as they began pursuing different projects benny and bj rn collaborated with tim rice to write the musical chess while agnetha and frida worked on solo albums after abba bj rn and benny wrote the music for the west end show chess one nine eight four with lyricist tim rice chess ran for three years in london the show also opened on broadway in
the us one nine eight eight but the song order lyrics and storyline had been altered compared with the london version and was less successful the show closed within weeks chess is best known today for producing the international hit one night in bangkok sung by murray head bj rn and benny inspired by the successes of rice and his former collaborator andrew lloyd webber had long expressed their desire to write a musical their first attempt had been a mini
musical the girl with the golden hair performed by the group during their one nine seven seven tour of europe and australia excerpts were included in abba the movie and abba the album bj rn and benny followed chess with kristina fr n duvem la one nine nine five directed for the stage by lars rudolfsson and based on the emigrants tetralogy by swedish novelist vilhelm moberg mamma mia a musical built around abba s songs had its london
premiere in one nine nine nine in two zero zero three their first musical was given new life in a swedish language version chess p svenska after being largely forgotten throughout most of the one nine eight zero s abba experienced a resurgence the attention was often
ironic along the lines of they were so they were good yet others recognised that while abba was often panned by critics and sneered at by punk and new wave musicians they were masters of their art the three minute pop song one nine nine two saw a huge revival of interest in abba with the release of their abba gold greatest hits compilation album selling massively worldwide and setting chart longevity records the revival was further validated by the one nine nine four film muriel s
wedding a popular australian film starring an abba loving protaganist bj rn and benny were finally recognised in two zero zero one with an ivor novello award for their songwriting many former punk and new wave artistes later admitted to levels of fondness and respect for abba they were unwilling to own up
to in their early years during the one nine nine zero s many abba tracks were rediscovered and covered
by other artists such as erasure ash and the a teens among others the avant garde band blancmange had also covered the day before you came in the mid one nine eight zero s one of the first bands to cover an abba track on

some rare appearances on german television fashion and videos abba was widely noted as an epitome of one nine seven zero s fashion for the colourful costumes its members wore the videos which accompanied some of their biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre though the beatles and the rolling stones had shot the occasional video clip making promotional videos
still hadn t become the industry standard by the early to mid one nine seven zero s most of abba s videos and abba the movie were directed by lasse hallstr m who would later direct the films my life as a dog the cider house rules and chocolat abba made videos because their songs were hits in so many different countries and personal appearances weren t always possible this was also an effort to minimise travelling particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights agnetha and bj rn had two young children and agnetha who was
also afraid of flying was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time
abba s manager stig anderson realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicise a single or album thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour some of these videos became classics because of the one nine seven zero s era costumes and early video effects such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs overlapping one girl s profile
with the other s full face and the contrasting of one member against another nowadays most of their videos can be seen on the dvds abba gold and the definitive collection a still from abba s music video or promo clip ring ring several abba videos were spoofed by others the video knowing me knowing you was satirised on the bbc comedy show not the nine o clock news as super dooper the

through confusion with another legal term allegeance an allegation the french allegeance comes from the english the word is formed from liege of which the derivation is given
under that heading the connection with latin ligare to bind is erroneous usage the term allegiance is often used by english legal commentators in a larger sense divided by
them into natural and local the latter applying to the deference which even a foreigner must pay to the institutions of
the country in which he happens to live but it is in its proper sense in which it indicates national character and the subjection due to that character that the word is important in that sense it represents the feudal liege homage which could be due only to one lord while simple homage might be due to every lord under whom the person in question held land united kingdom the english doctrine which was at one time adopted in the united states asserted that allegiance was indelible nemo potest

about two games a year initially the games were drawn from the founders imagination with themes ranging from fantasy to horror and sometimes science fiction some of the later games were written by scott adams and other collaborators adventure internationals games became known for quality with a reputation only exceeded in the field at the

famous for his science fiction novel two zero zero one
a space odyssey and for collaborating with director stanley kubrick on the film of the same name clarke is considered one of the big three of science fiction along with robert a heinlein and isaac asimov he is the only one still alive two zero zero one a space odyssey was written concurrently with the film version by stanley kubrick it was loosely inspired by clarke s short story the sentinel but became its own novel while he was collaborating on a screenplay with kubrick kubrick approached clarke about writing a novel for the
express purpose of making the proverbial good science fiction movie and the novel was still being written while the film was being made this resulted in one of the truly unique collaborations in media history clarke has written numerous other books including the
rama novels and several sequels to two zero zero one and many short stories including the star about a jesuit priest s spiritual dilemma an asteroid is named in clarke s honour four nine
two three clarke as is a species of ceratopsian dinosaur serendipaceratops arthurcclarkei discovered in inverloch in australia the two zero zero one mars odyssey orbiter is named in honor of sir arthur s works in the one nine four zero s he forecast that man would reach the moon by the year two zero zero zero an idea experts dismissed as rubbish when neil armstrong landed in one nine six nine the united states said clarke provided the essential
intellectual drive that led us to the moon he lives in sri lanka and survived the tsunamis of the two zero zero four indian ocean earthquake but lost his diving school on hikkaduwa clarke holds citizenship of both the uk and sri lanka biography clarke was born in minehead in somerset england and as a boy enjoyed stargazing and enthusiastically read old american science fiction magazines many of which made their way to england as ballast in ships after secondary school and studying at
richard huish college taunton he was unable to afford a university education and consequently acquired a job as an auditor in the
pensions section of the board of education during the second world war he served in the royal air force as a radar specialist and was involved in the early warning radar defense system which contributed to the raf s success during the battle of britain he retired in the rank of flight lieutenant after the war he obtained a first class degree in mathematics and physics at king s college london his most important contribution may be the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays he proposed this concept in a paper titled extra
terrestrial relays can rocket stations give worldwide radio coverage published in wireless world in october one nine four five the geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the clarke orbit in his honour however it is not clear that his article was actually the inspiration for modern telecommunications satellites john r pierce of bell labs arrived at the idea independently in one nine five four and he was actually involved in the echo satellite and telstar projects however pierce stated that the idea was in the air at the time and certain to be developed regardless
of clarke s publication clarke s first professional sale was in one nine four six to astounding science fiction the still memorable short story rescue party along with his writing clarke worked briefly as assistant editor of science abstracts one nine four nine before devoting himself to writing full time from one nine five one
clarke also contributed to the dan dare series and his first three published novels were for a juvenile audience he has been chairman of the british interplanetary society and a member of the underwater explorers club his work is marked by its optimistic view of science empowering mankind s exploration of the solar system and an obvious influence was the work of olaf stapledon
in one nine five one he wrote the sentinel for a bbc competition though the story was rejected it changed the course of clarke s career not only the basis for two zero zero one the sentinel introduced a more mystical and cosmic element
to clarke s work many of clarke s later works feature a technologically advanced but prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence in the cases of the city and the stars childhood s end and the
two zero zero one series this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution he has lived in sri lanka since one nine five six immigrating when it was still called ceylon
first in unawatuna on the south coast and then in colombo this inspired the locale for his novel the fountains of paradise in which he describes a space elevator this he figures will ultimately be his legacy more so than geostationary satellites once space elevators make space shuttles obsolete
early in his career clarke had a fascination with the paranormal and has stated that it was part of
the inspiration for his novel childhood s end he has also said that he was one of several who were fooled by a uri geller demonstration at birkbeck college although he has long since dismissed and distanced himself from nearly all pseudoscience he still advocates for research into purported instances of psychokinesis and other similar phenomena following the release of two zero
zero one clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology especially at the time of the apollo space program he also signed a three book publishing deal a record for a science fiction writer the first of
the three was rendezvous with rama in one nine seven three which won him all the main genre awards and has spawned sequels that along with the two zero zero one series
formed the backbone of clarke s later career in one nine seven five his short story the star was not included as prose in a new high school english textbook in sri lanka because it was felt that it might offend roman catholics although it had been selected the textbook caused controversy because it replaced shakespeare s work with that of bob dylan
john lennon and isaac asimov clarke is also well known to many for his television programmes arthur c clarke s mysterious world one nine eight one and arthur c clarke s world of strange powers one nine eight four in one nine eight six clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money initially one zero zero zero for the arthur c
clarke award for the best science fiction novel published in britain in the previous year in two zero zero one the prize was increased to two zero zero one and its value now matches the year i e two zero zero five in two zero zero five in one nine eight eight he was diagnosed with post polio syndrome and has since needed to use a wheelchair his knighthood was first announced in one nine nine eight but then the british tabloid the sunday mirror published accusations of paedophilia against him the
award was delayed while the allegations were investigated although by two zero zero zero the bbc reported
that he had been cleared clarke s health did not allow him to travel to london to receive the honour personally from the queen so the uk high commissioner to sri lanka awarded him the title
of knight bachelor at a ceremony in colombo he is currently the honorary board chair of the institute for cooperation in space founded by carol rosin and on the board of governors

station islands in the sky were all genre sf mainstays clarke s background as a technical writer showed in the early novels as a deliberate documentary style and his characters reflect clarke s experience by being mostly military or civil service types despite this clarke s style was open to humour and a degree of whimsy which salted its propagandist tone regarding scientific advancement with a sting in the tail a recurring
type of character is found in the lion of comarre the city and the stars the road to the sea and other works a young man in a superficially utopian society becomes dissatisfied and restless and seeks to expand his horizons thereby discovering
the underlying decadence of his own society the sentinel introduced a religious theme to clarke s work his interest in the paranormal was influenced by charles fort and embraced the belief that mankind may be the property of an ancient alien civilization surprisingly for a writer who is often held up as an
example of hard science fiction s obsession with technology three of clarke s novels have this as a theme the adapted screenplays of arthur c clarke two zero zero one a space odyssey clarke s first venture into film was the stanley kubrick directed two zero zero one a space odyssey kubrick and clarke had met in one nine six four to discuss
the possibility of a collaborative film project as the idea developed it was decided that the story for the film was to be loosely based on clarke s short story the sentinel written in one nine four eight as an entry in a bbc short story competition originally clarke was going
to write the screenplay for the film but this proved to be more tedious than he had estimated instead kubrick and clarke decided it
would be best to write a novel first and then adapt it for the film upon its completion however as clarke was finishing the book the screenplay was also being written simultaneously due to the hectic schedule of the film s production kubrick and clarke had
difficulty collaborating on the book clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of one nine six four with the plan to publish the novel in one nine six five in advance of the film s release in one nine six six after many delays the film was released in the spring of one nine six eight before the book was completed it was credited to clarke alone clarke later complained that this had the effect of
making the book into a novelisation that kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay his authorship for these and other reasons the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie the film is a bold artistic piece with little explanation for the events taking place clarke on the other hand wrote thorough explanations of
cause and effect for the events in the novel despite their differences both film and novel were well received in one nine seven two clarke published the lost worlds of two zero zero one
which included his account of the production and alternate versions of key scenes the special edition of the novel a space odyssey released in one nine nine nine contains an introduction by clarke documenting his account of the events leading to the release of the novel and film two zero one zero the year we make contact in one nine eight two clarke continued the two zero zero one epic with a sequel two zero one zero odyssey two this novel was also made into a film two zero one zero

simply newton was an early line of personal digital assistants developed manufactured and marketed by apple computer from one nine nine three to one nine nine eight the original newtons were based on the arm six one zero risc processor and featured handwriting recognition apple s official
name for the device was messagepad the term newton was apple s name for the operating system it used but popular usage of the word newton has grown to include the device and its software together the newton in development the newton project was not originally intended to produce a pda the pda category did not exist for most of newton s genesis and the
personal digital assistant moniker itself was coined relatively late in the development cycle by apple s then ceo john sculley the driving force behind the project newton was in fact intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing for most of its design lifecycle newton had a large format screen more internal memory and a rich object oriented graphics kernel one of the original motivating scenarios for the design was known as the architect scenario in which newton s designers imagined a residential architect working quickly with a client to sketch clean up and interactively modify a
simple two dimensional home plan for a portion of the newton s development cycle
roughly the middle third the project s primary programming language was dylan a
small efficient object oriented lisp variant that still retains some interest although it was efficient for its day and considering its substantial run time dynamism dylan was a tough sell for the large format newton and for
a development team unused to lisp programming with the move to the smaller form factor dylan was relegated to experimental status in the bauhaus project and eventually cancelled outright had it been retained dylan with garbage collection and close os integration would have preceded microsoft s managed code revolution by over a decade the
project missed by far its original goals to reinvent personal computing and then to rewrite contemporary application programming the newton project s broad vision fell victim to project slippage feature creep and a growing fear that it would interfere with macintosh sales it was reinvented as a pda which would be a complementary macintosh peripheral instead of a stand alone computer which might compete with the macintosh technical details newton used an advanced
object oriented programming system called newtonscript developed by apple employee walter smith one of the major complaints programmers had was that the toolbox programming environment was overpriced at one zero zero zero later in the life of the newton the programming environment was made available free of charge additionally it required learning a new way of programming despite
this many third party and shareware applications were and continue to be available for newton it has been suggested that the newtonscript programming system should be made available open source as abandonware but most newton enthusiasts consider this possibility to be highly unlikely data in newton was
stored in object oriented databases known as soups one of the revolutionary aspects of newton was that soups were available to all programs and programs could operate cross soup meaning that the calendar could refer to names in the address book a note in the notepad could be converted to an appointment and so forth and the soups could be programmer extended a new address book enhancement could be built on the data from
the existing address book while the soup concept worked remarkably well within the newton system itself it caused several usability issues first it made it extremely difficult to synchronize data with other systems
like a desktop macintosh or pc making the newton a data island apple s utility to perform this task the newton connection utility was exceedingly complex and was never completed to perform to the satisfaction of most users the realization that a handheld computer needed to work within the existing data environment of its users was key to the success of the
later palm pilot platform even though the palm was technically inferior the second consequence of the data object soup was that objects could extend built in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that newton users could not distinguish which program or add on object
was responsible for the various features on their own system a user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long forgotten downloaded extension was missing data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves were tossed in the storage area of the extras drawer there was no built
in distinction between types of data in that area for example an installed application s icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list
there was no easy way to get a listing of all user installed objects on a system finally the data soup concept worked well for data like
addresses which benefit from being shared cross functionally but it worked poorly for discrete data sets like files and
documents this difficulty in working and sharing data with other systems stemming from the too revolutionary data object soup system was a key contributor to newton s demise earlier messagepads used macintosh standard serial ports round mini din eight connectors instead of the more common trapezoidal de nine commonly called db nine the two zero zero zero two one zero zero models had a proprietary small flat connector called an interconnect port used with an adapter in addition all models had infrared connectivity unlike the palm all messagepad models were equipped with
a standard pcmcia expansion slot two on the two zero zero zero two one zero zero this allowed native modem and even ethernet connectivity newton users have also written drivers for eight zero two one one b wireless networking cards
and ata type flash memory cards a category that includes the popular compactflash format as well as for bluetooth cards with the one xx series an optional keyboard became available which could also be used via the dongle on a two x zero zero newton could also dial a phone number through the messagepad speaker simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker and fax email support was built in at the operating system level although it required external cards the messagepad two zero zero zero and two one zero zero with a vastly improved handwriting recognition
system one six two mhz strongarmsa one one zero risc processor newton two one and a better clearer backlit screen attracted critical plaudits although their size and expense were factors which kept them from being as popular as later palmos devices the newton still has a small but passionate user base the final evolution of the newton s handwriting recognition system is still considered by many to be very impressive only matched by the more modern tablet pc handwriting
recognition system the messagepad could be used with the screen turned horizontally landscape as well as vertically portrait a change of a setting would instantly rotate the contents of the display by ninety degrees handwriting recognition would still work properly with the display rotated the use of four x aa nicd messagepad one one zero one two zero and one three zero and four x aa nimh cells two x zero zero series emate three zero zero gave a runtime of up to three
zero hours mp two one zero zero w two x two zero mb linear flash memory pc cards no backlight usage and up to two four hours with backlight on while adding more weight to the newtons than aaa batteries as used in the messagepad and messagepad one zero zero or custom battery packs the choice of an easily replaceable rechargeable cell format gave the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply this together with the flash memory used as internal storage if all cells lost their power no data was lost due to
the static character of this storage gave birth to the slogan newton never dies it only gets new batteries apple and third parties marketed several wallets cases for the messagepads which would
hold them securely along with the owner s credit cards driver s license business cards and cash these wallets were even larger than the messagepads and even less able to fit in a pocket so they were most often used as a protective case for the unit to shield it from bumps and scratches outcome
although the apple newton was produced for six years it was never as successful in the marketplace as apple had hoped this has been attributed to two primary reasons the newton s high price which went up to one
zero zero zero when models two zero zero zero and two one zero zero were introduced and its large size it failed the pocket test by not fitting in an average coat shirt or trouser pocket critics also panned its handwriting recognition these initial problems marred newton s reputation in the eyes of the public and pdas would remain a niche product until palm inc s palm pilot which emerged shortly before the newton was discontinued the palm pilot with its smaller thinner
shape cheaper cost and more robust graffiti handwriting recognition system which had been available first as a software package for the newton managed to
restore the viability of the pda market after newton s commercial failure ironically palm computing was founded by ex apple employee donna dubinsky the newton marketing campaign trumpeted the product s handwriting recognition though in initial versions it was fairly inaccurate the original handwriting recognition engine was called calligrapher and was licensed from a russian company called paragraph international it was actually quite sophisticated unlike the later palm pilot s graffiti which made the user learn a
new handwriting system and write each letter in an input area newton learned the user s natural handwriting using a database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen newton could also recognize and clean up simple drawn shapes such as triangles circles and squares and had an intuitive system for handwritten editing such as scratching out words to be deleted circling text to be selected or using written carets to mark inserts later
releases of the newton operating system retained the original recognizer for compatibility but added a printed text recognizer code named rosetta which was developed by apple included in version two zero of the newton operating system and refined in newton
two one rosetta was generally considered a significant improvement and many users consider the newton two one handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives since recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as one two was also under development but never released the most critical feature of the newton handwriting recognition system was the modeless error correction that
is correction done in situation without using a separate window or widget using a minimum of gestures if a word was recognized improperly the user would simply double tap the word and a list of alternatives would pop up in a menu under the stylus most of the time the correct word would be in the list if not
a button at the bottom of the list allowed the user to edit individual characters in that word error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process greatly increasing the interruption to a user s workflow that a given correction requires excellent handwriting recognition in os
two one and higher with smooth modeless access to robust error correction is quite possibly a leading reason for the continued popularity of the device among newton users even given the age of the hardware
and software newtons still demand a sale price on the used market far greater than that of pdas produced by other companies as of two zero zero four the newton two zero zero zero and two one zero zero can still fetch a price without accessories of over one zero zero later efforts many prototypes of additional newton models were spotted most notable was a newton tablet or slate a large flat screen that could be written on others included a kids newton with side handgrips and buttons videopads which would have incorporated a video camera and screen on their
flip top covers for two way communications the mini two
zero zero zero which would have been very similar to palm pilot and the newtonphone developed by siemens ag which incorporated a handset and a keyboard at least one product the emate three zero zero was derived from the apple newton and was offered to schools in one nine nine seven as an inexpensive seven nine nine us originally sold to education markets only and durable computer for classroom use however in order to achieve its low price the emate three zero
zero did not have all the features of the contemporary newton equivalent the messagepad two zero zero zero and was cancelled along with the rest of the newton line before the
newton project was cancelled it was spun off into its own company newton inc but was reabsorbed several months later when steve jobs ousted apple ceo gil amelio and resumed control of apple there has since been continual speculation that apple might release a
new pda with some newton technology or collaborate with palm apple continues to deny that such a project will ever happen the apple ipod is somewhat of a descendant of the newton
in that it is a pocket sized programmable device based on the arm processor two ex apple newton developers founded pixo the company that created the ipod s
os feeding a bit of speculation apple put the print recognizer part of the newton two one handwriting recognition system into mac os x version one zero two known as jaguar it can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen
this technology known as inkwell appears in the system preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in whether apple will ever utilize such technology again in a handheld device remains to be seen in june two zero zero four apple ceo steve jobs indicated that he was proud that apple resisted pressure to market a new handheld computer while a small group of mac faithful consumers have lobbied apple to sell such a device the worldwide market for pdas was in a decline at the time and
apple chose not to develop the device because demand would have been inadequate newton models messagepad also known as the h one zero zero zero omp or original messagepad messagepad one zero zero supported newer newton os messagepad one one zero slightly longer and narrower with integrated flip cover and retracting stylus

to a number of third party developers including sharp and motorola who developed additional pda devices that used the operating system motorola added added wireless connectivity to the unit and renamed it the marco a possible newton revival has been a common source of speculation among the macintosh user base when patents for a tablet based macintosh were applied for http www appleinsider com article php id six zero zero rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new tablet pc style macintosh appearances in popular culture the newton was featured in the movie under siege two

ridiculed it in a series of episodes of his popular comic doonesbury
the last panel of one strip which shows a character reading the words egg freckles from his newton became an easter egg in the newton operating system itself version two zero and earlier it can be seen by writing the words egg freckles then highlighting them and tapping the assist button in an episode of the simpsons titled lisa on ice which first aired november one three one nine nine four school bully kearny has his buddy daulph take a memo on a newton when daulph writes beat up martin on the screen the handwriting recognition turns it

in two zero zero four cnet elected the apple newton one of the top one zero tech we miss mentioning the device s amusing willingness to translate nearly any stroke on the screen to text allowing the user to generate surreal newton poetry from random scribbles other uses there were a number of projects that used the newton as a portable information device in cultural settings such as museums for example visible interactive created a walking tour in san francisco s chinatown but the most significant effort took place in malaysia at the petronas
discovery center known as petrosains in one nine nine five an exhibit
design firm dmcd inc was awarded the contract to design a new one zero zero zero zero zero square foot science museum in the petronas towers in kuala lumpur a major factor
in the award was the concept that visitors would use a newton to access additional information find out where they were in the museum listen to audio see animations control robots and other media and to bookmark information for printout at the end of the exhibit the device became known as the arif a malay word for wise man or seer and it was also an acronym for a resourceful informative friend some four zero zero arifs were installed and over two
five zero are still in use today the development of the arif system was extremely complex and required a team of hardware and software engineers designers and writers the exhibition design and arif coordination team was led by scott guerin the hardware software team by ted paschkis and the writers and interface designers included paul trapido and michael callan mssrs guerin and paschkis went on to found wivid systems which specializes in multimedia tour guides for museums arif is an ancestor of the pda systems used in museums today and
it boasted features that have not been attempted since for example it was used as an exploration tool in a large exhibit about exploring for oil a visitor s success completing one
task influenced the success or failure of a subsequent task at the conclusion of the exhibit the arif was docked at an ir port where it was used to control a robotic arm that placed equipment at locations influenced by the users previous lessons in another exhibit up to eight devices could be used at to activate a six zero foot diameter
model of prehistoric malaysia volcano eruptions animal sounds lighting effects and wind are among the many effects this task was accomplished by docking the arif at a computer terminal and using it as
the input device there are no touch screens in petrosains all interactive systems were controlled by the arif the newton was married to a primitive packet switching radio system in order to determine its location as the visitor passed through electronic gateways when the visitor entered a new room the radio triggered an automatic area introduction the radio also delivered time synch d audio in two languages to a group of users when they watched a video in
addition to being dual language in all audio and text the arif stored bookmarked information such that at

popular and highly esteemed science fiction writers of the one nine four zero s during the ascent of the genre s golden age after starting his writing career by writing for true confession style pulp magazines like true story van vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed science fiction van vogt s first published sf story black destroyer astounding science fiction
july one nine three nine was inspired by the origin of species by charles darwin the story depicted a fierce carnivorous alien stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship it was the cover story of the issue of astounding which ushered in the golden age of
science fiction the story became an instant classic and eventually served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies in one nine five zero it was combined with war of nerves one nine five zero discord in scarlet one nine three nine and m three three in andromeda one nine four three to form the novel the voyage of
the space beagle one nine five zero many fans of that era would have named van vogt robert a heinlein and isaac asimov as the three greatest science fiction writers in one nine four one van vogt decided to become a full time writer quitting his job at the canadian department of national defence extremely prolific for a few years van vogt wrote a large number of short stories in the one nine five zero s many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels or fixups as he called them a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction
criticism sometimes this was successful the war against the rull while other times the disparate stories thrown together made for a less coherent plot quest for the future one of van
vogt s best novels of this period is slan which appeared in astounding sicence fiction in one nine four zero using what became one of van vogt s recurring themes it told the story
of a nine year old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by homo sapiens a post war philosopher in one nine four four van vogt moved to hollywood california where his writing took on new dimensions after world war ii van vogt was always interested in the idea of all encompassing systems of knowledge akin to modern meta systems the characters in his very first story used a system called nexialism to analyze the alien s behaviour and he became interested in the general semantics
of alfred korzybski and he was profoundly affected by revelations of totalitarian police states that emerged after world war ii he wrote a mainstream novel that was set in communist china the angry man one nine six two he said that prior to this he had read one zero zero books about china he subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes the world of null a and the pawns of null a

using scenes of eight zero zero words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved several of his stories hinge upon temporal conundrums a favorite theme he stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from books on writing by thomas uzzell he said many of his ideas came from dreams and indeed his stories at times had the incoherence of dreams but at their best as in the fantasy novel the book of ptath his works had all the vision and power
a dream can impart throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every nine zero minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams in the one nine five zero s van vogt briefly became involved in l ron hubbard s dianetics van vogt operated a storefront for the secular precursor to hubbard s scientology sect in the los angeles area for a time before winding up at odds with hubbard and his methods his writing more or less stopped for some years a period in
which he bitterly claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by hubbard s followers in this period he limited to collect old short stories to form notable fixups like the mixed men one nine five two the war against the rull one nine five nine the beast one nine six three and the two novels
of the linn cyle which were inspired by fall of the roman empire he resumed writing again in the one nine six zero s mainly through frederik pohl s invitation while remaining in hollywood with his second wife lydia bereginsky who took care of him through his declining years in this period his stories were born since the very beginning as whole novels but in general show van vogt s difficulties in keeping pace with the evolution of science fiction recognition in one nine four six van vogt and his first wife edna mayne hull were co

for six decades of golden age science fiction and the science fiction and fantasy hall of fame included him among its initial four inductees critical praise famous science fiction author philip k dick has said that van vogt s stories spurred his interest in science fiction with their strange sense of the unexplained that something more was going on than the protagonists realized in a review of transfinite the essential a e van vogt science fiction writer paul di filippo said van vogt

creutzfeldt jakob disease the latter with hans gerhard creutzfeldt and helped greatly in the description of various other neurological illnesses one eight eight four births one nine three one deaths neurologists atheism in its broadest sense is an absence of belief
in the existence of gods this definition includes as atheists both those who assert that there are no gods and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not narrower definitions however
often only qualify those who assert there are no gods as atheists labeling the others as nontheists or agnostics although atheists often share common concerns regarding empirical evidence and the scientific method of investigation and a large number are skeptics there is no single ideology that all atheists share additionally there are certain individuals whose religious or spiritual beliefs some might describe as atheistic though those holding such beliefs do not normally describe themselves as atheists atheism should not be confused with the related but not equivalent position of
antitheism as many atheists do not directly oppose theism etymology in early ancient greek the adjective atheos from privative a theos gods meant without gods or lack of belief in gods the word acquired
an additional meaning in the five th century bce expressing a total lack of relations with the gods that is denying the gods godless ungodly with more active connotations than aseb s impious modern translations of classical texts sometimes translate atheos as atheistic as an abstract noun there was also atheot s atheism
cicero transliterated atheos into latin the discussion of atheoi was pronounced in the debate between early christians and pagans who each attributed atheism to the other a b drachmann one nine two two notes atheism and atheist are words formed from greek roots and with greek derivative endings
nevertheless they are not greek their formation is not consonant with greek usage in greek they said atheos and atheotes to these the english words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely in exactly the same way as ungodly atheos was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation this use is an old one and the oldest that can be traced not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed p five in english the term atheism is the result of the adoption
of the french ath isme in about one five eight seven the term atheist in the sense of one who denies or disbelieves actually predates atheism being first attested in about one five seven one the phrase italian atheoi is recorded as early as one five six eight atheist in the sense of practical godlessness was first attested in one five seven
seven the french word is derived from ath e godless atheist which in turn is from the greek atheos the words deist and theist entered english after atheism being first attested in one six two one and one six six two respectively with theism and deism following in one six seven eight and one six eight two
respectively deism and theism exchanged meanings around one seven zero zero due to the influence of atheism deism was originally used with a meaning comparable to today s theism
and vice versa the oxford english dictionary also records an earlier irregular formation atheonism dated from about one five three four the later and now obsolete words
athean and atheal are dated to one six one one and one six one two respectively types and typologies of atheism many people have disagreed on how best to characterize atheism and much of the literature on the subject is erroneous or confusing there are many discrepancies in the use of terminology between proponents and opponents of atheism and even divergent definitions among those who share near identical beliefs among proponents of atheism and neutral parties there are two major traditions in defining atheism and its subdivisions the first tradition understands atheism very
broadly as including both those who believe gods don t exist strong atheism and
those who are simply not theists weak atheism george h smith michael martin and formerly antony flew fall into this tradition though they do not use the same terminology flew has recently adopted a form of deism the second
tradition understands atheism more narrowly as the conscious rejection of theism and does not consider absence of theistic belief or suspension of judgment concerning theism to be forms of atheism ernest nagel paul edwards and kai nielsen are prominent members of this camp using this definition of atheism implicit atheism lack of theism without the conscious rejection of
it may not be regarded as atheistic at all and the umbrella term nontheism may be used in its place a third tradition more common among laypeople understands atheism even more narrowly than that here atheism is defined in the strongest possible terms as
the belief that there is no god such usage is not exclusive to laypeople however atheist philosopher theodore drange uses the narrow definition atheism as lack of theism among modern atheists the view that atheism means
without or polemically free of theistic beliefs has a great deal of currency this very broad definition is justified by reference to etymology as well as consistent usage of the word by atheists however this definition of atheism has not gone
unchallenged although over the last few hundred years atheism has evolved and broadened beyond the narrow meaning of wickedness impiety heresy and religious denial as well as pantheism and similar beliefs it is less commonly understood to include everything not explicitly theistic whether a writer s definition of atheism as an absence or lack of theistic belief is in fact intended to mean not theistic in the widest possible sense
or just refers to particular forms of the rejection of theism see below is often ambiguous however while this definition of atheism is frequently disputed it is not a recent invention this use has a history spanning over two three zero years two atheist writers who are clear in defining atheism so broadly that uninformed children are counted as atheists are d holbach one seven seven two all children are born atheists
they have no idea of god and george h smith one nine seven nine according to smith the man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he
does not believe in a god this category would also include the child without the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved but who is still unaware of those issues the fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist p one four one
atheist writer who explicitly disagrees with such a broad definition is ernest nagel one nine six five atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief thus a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about god is not an atheist for he is not denying any theistic claims p four six zero four six one for nagel atheism is the rejection of theism not just the absence
of theistic belief however this definition leaves open the question of what term can be used to describe those who lack theistic belief
but do not necessarily reject theism the obsolete word atheous first recorded in the oxford english dictionary as a synonym of atheism or impiety is sometimes used to mean not dealing with the existence of a god in a purely privative sense as distinguished from the negative atheistic this one eight eight zero coinage captures some of what is intended by the broad definition of atheism
though it is hard to sustain the claim that the philosophical rejection of theism can be characterized in such terms implicit and explicit atheism a chart showing the relationship between the weak strong positive negative and implicit explicit dichotomies strong atheism is always explicit and implicit atheism is always weak the terms implicit atheism and explicit atheism were coined by george h smith one nine seven nine p one three one eight implicit atheism is defined by smith as the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it explicit atheism is defined as the absence of
theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it which according to smith is sometimes called antitheism see below for smith explicit atheism is subdivided further according to
whether or not the rejection is on rational grounds the term critical atheism is used to label the view that belief in god is irrational and is itself subdivided into a the view usually expressed by the statement i do not believe in the existence of a god or supernatural being b the view usually expressed by the statement god does not exist or the existence of god is impossible and c the view which refuses to discuss the existence or nonexistence of a god because the concept of a god is unintelligible p one seven although nagel rejects smith
s definition of atheism as merely lack of theism acknowledging only explicit atheism as true atheism his tripartite classification of rejectionist atheism commonly found in the philosophical literature is identical to smith s critical atheism typology the difference between nagel on the one hand and d holbach and smith on the other has been attributed to the different concerns of professional philosophers and layman proponents of atheism see smith one nine nine zero
chapter three p five one six zero for example but also alluded to by others everitt two zero zero four makes the point that professional philosophers are more interested in the grounds for giving or withholding assent to propositions we need to distinguish between a biographical or sociological enquiry into why some people have believed or disbelieved in god and an epistemological enquiry into whether there are any good reasons for either belief or unbelief we are interested in the question of
what good reasons there are for or against god s existence and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having good reasons for them p one zero so in philosophy flew and martin notwithstanding atheism is commonly defined along the lines of rejection of theistic belief this is often misunderstood to mean only the view that there is no god but it is conventional to distinguish between
two or three main sub types of atheism in this sense writers differ in their characterization of this distinction and in the labels they use for these positions the terms weak atheism and strong atheism or negative atheism and positive atheism are often used as synonyms of smith
s less well known implicit and explicit categories however the original and technical meanings of implicit and explicit atheism are quite different and distinct from weak and strong atheism having to do with conscious rejection and
unconscious rejection of theism rather than with positive belief and negative belief people who do not use the broad definition of atheism as lack of theism but instead use the most common definition disbelief in or denial of the existence of god or gods would not recognize mere absence of belief in deities implicit atheism as a type of atheism at all and would tend to use other terms such as skeptic or agnostic or non atheistic nontheism for this position atheism as immorality the first attempts to define or develop a typology of atheism were
in religious apologetics these attempts were expressed in terminologies and in contexts which reflected the religious assumptions and prejudices of the writers a diversity of atheist opinion has been recognized at least
since plato and common distinctions have been established between practical atheism and speculative or contemplative atheism practical atheism practical atheism was said to be caused by moral failure hypocrisy willful ignorance
and infidelity practical atheists behaved as though god morals ethics and social responsibility did not exist maritain s typology of atheism one nine five three chapter eight proved influential in catholic circles it was followed in the new catholic encyclopedia see reid one nine six seven he identified in addition to practical atheism pseudo atheism and absolute atheism and subdivided theoretical atheism in a way that anticipated flew for an atheist critique of maritain see smith one nine seven nine chapter one section five according to the french catholic philosopher tienne borne one nine
six one p one zero practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of god but complete godlessness of action it is
a moral evil implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law according to karen armstrong one nine nine nine during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the word atheist was still
reserved exclusively for polemic in his tract atheism closed and open anatomized one six three four john wingfield claimed
the hypocrite is an atheist the loose wicked man is an open atheist the secure bold and proud transgressor is an atheist he that will not be taught or reformed is an atheist for the welsh poet william vaughan one five seven seven sic one six four one who helped in the colonisation of newfoundland those who raised rents or enclosed commons were obvious atheists the english dramatist thomas nashe one five six seven
one six zero one proclaimed that the ambitious the greedy the gluttons the vainglorious and prostitutes were all atheists the term
atheist was an insult nobody would have dreamed of calling himself an atheist p three three one three three two on the other hand the existence of serious speculative atheism was often
denied that anyone might reason their way to atheism was thought to be impossible thus speculative atheism was collapsed into a form of practical atheism or conceptualized as hatred of god or a fight against god this is why borne finds it necessary to say to put forward the idea as some apologists rashly do that there are no atheists except in name but only practical atheists who through pride or idleness disregard the divine law would be at least at the beginning of the argument a rhetorical convenience or an emotional prejudice evading the real question
p one eight martin one nine nine zero p four six five four six six suggests that practical atheism would be better described as alienated theism other pejorative definitions of atheism when denial of the existence of speculative atheism became unsustainable atheism was nevertheless often repressed and criticized by narrowing definitions applying charges of dogmatism and otherwise misrepresenting atheist positions one of the reasons for the popularity of euphemistic alternative terms like secularist empiricist agnostic
or bright is that atheism still has pejorative connotations arising from attempts at suppression and from its association with practical atheism godless is still used as an abusive epithet mynga futrell and paul geisert the originators of the term bright made this explicit in an essay
published in two zero zero three our personal frustration regarding labels reached culmination last fall when we were invited to join a march on washington as godless americans the causes of the march were worthy and the march itself well planned and conducted however to unite for common interests under a disparaging term like godless it also means wicked seemed ludicrous why accept and utilize the very derogatory language that so clearly hampers our own capacity to play a positive and
contributing role in our communities and in the nation and world gaskin one nine eight nine abandoned the term atheism in favour of unbelief citing the pejorative associations of the term its vagueness and later the tendency of religious apologists to define atheism so that no one could be an atheist p four despite these considerations for others atheist has always been the preferred name charles bradlaugh once said in debate with george jacob holyoake one zero march one eight seven zero cited in bradlaugh
bonner one nine zero eight i maintain that the opprobrium cast upon the word atheism is a lie i believe atheists as a body to be men deserving respect i do not care what kind of character religious men may
put round the word atheist i would fight until men respect it p three three four for more on repressive definitions of atheism see berman one nine eight two one nine eight three one nine nine zero weak and strong atheism main articles weak atheism strong atheism weak atheism sometimes called soft atheism negative atheism or neutral atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities without the positive assertion that deities do not exist strong atheism also known as hard atheism or positive atheism is the
belief that no deities exist while the terms weak and strong are relatively recent the concepts they represent have been in use for some time in earlier philosophical publications the terms negative atheism and positive atheism were more common these terms were used by antony flew in one nine seven two although jacques maritain one nine five three chapter eight p one zero four used the phrases in a similar but strictly catholic apologist context as early as one nine four nine although explicit atheists nontheists who consciously reject theism may subscribe to either weak or strong
atheism weak atheism also includes implicit atheists that is nontheists who have not consciously rejected theism but
lack theistic belief arguably including infants theists claim that a single deity or group of deities exists weak atheists do not assert the contrary
instead they only refrain from assenting to theistic claims some weak atheists are without any opinion regarding the existence of deities either because of a lack of thought on the matter a lack of interest in the matter see apatheism or
a belief that the arguments and evidence provided by both theists and strong atheists are equally unpersuasive others explicit weak atheists may
doubt or dispute claims for the existence of deities while not actively asserting that deities do not exist following wittgenstein s famous dictum whereof one cannot speak thereof one must remain silent some weak atheists feel that theism and strong atheism are equally untenable on the grounds that faith is required both to assert and to deny
the existence of deities and as such both theism and strong atheism have the burden of
proof placed on them to prove that a god does or doesn t exist some also base their belief on the notion that it is impossible to prove a negative while a weak atheist might consider the nonexistence of deities likely on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to justify belief in a deity s existence a strong atheist has the additional view that positive statements of nonexistence are merited when evidence or arguments indicate that a deity s nonexistence is
certain or probable strong atheism may be based on arguments that the concept of a deity is self contradictory and therefore impossible positive ignosticism or that one or more of the properties attributed to a deity are incompatible with what we observe in the world examples of this may be found in quantum physics where the existence of mutually exclusive data negates the possibility of omniscience usually a core attribute of monotheistic conceptions of deity agnosticism is distinct from strong atheism though many weak atheists may be agnostics and those who
are strong atheists with regard to a particular deity might be weak atheists
or agnostics with regard to other deities ignosticism main article ignosticism ignosticism is the view that the question of whether or not deities
exist is inherently meaningless it is a popular view among many logical positivists such as rudolph carnap and a j ayer who hold that talk of gods is literally nonsense according to ignostics does a god exist has the same logical status as what color is saturday they are both nonsensical and thus have no meaningful answers ignostics commonly hold that statements about religious or other transcendent experiences cannot have any truth value often because theological statements lack falsifiability because of an epistemological view
that renders the ontological argument nonsensical or because the terminology being used has not been properly or consistently defined the latter view is
known as theological noncognitivism the use of the word god is thus solely a matter of semantics to ignostics dealing with word use and technicalities rather than with existence and reality in language truth and
logic ayer stated that theism atheism and agnosticism were equally meaningless insofar as they treat the question of the existence of god as a real question however there are varieties of atheism and agnosticism which do not necessarily agree that the question is meaningful especially using the lack of theism definition of atheism despite ayer s criticism of atheism perhaps using the definition typically associated with strong atheism ignosticism is usually counted as a form of atheism ayer one nine six six was clear on his position i do not
believe in god it seems to me that theists of all
kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible and to the extent that they have made it intelligible they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it p two two six the ignostic position is mentioned though the term ignostic is not used as one of the three forms of critical atheism in smith or rejectionist atheism in nagel active disbelief in god or supernatural beings is one other type of critical rejectionist atheism finally the third type
is the positive claim that deities do not exist since critical rejectionist atheism is a type of explicit atheism if follows that ignosticism is a type of explicit atheism there is some debate over whether it should be classified as weak atheism or strong atheism ignosticism is distinct from apatheism in that while ignostics hold questions and discussions of whether
deities exist to be meaningless apatheists hold that even a hypothetical answer to such questions would be completely irrelevant to human existence gnostic and agnostic atheism main article agnostic atheism agnostic atheism is a fusion of atheism or nontheism with agnosticism the epistemological position that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown weak agnosticism or unknowable strong agnosticism agnostic atheism is typically contrasted with agnostic theism the belief that deities
exist even though it is impossible to know that deities exist and with gnostic atheism the belief that there is enough information to determine
that deities do not exist agnostic atheism s definition varies just as the definitions of agnosticism and atheism do it may be a combination of lack of theism with strong agnosticism the view that it is impossible to know whether deities exist to any reliable degree it may also be a combination of lack of theism with weak agnosticism the
view that there is not currently enough information to decide whether or not a deity exists but that there may be enough in the future gnostic atheism is a more rarely used term because often anyone who is not labeled as agnostic is assumed to be gnostic by default gnostic atheism also has varying meanings when nontheism is combined with strong gnosticism it denotes the belief that it is rational to be absolutely certain
that deities do not and perhaps cannot exist when it is with weak gnosticism it denotes the belief that there is
enough information to be reasonably sure that deities do not exist but not absolutely certain the term should not be confused with gnosticism gnostic atheism is also sometimes used as a synonym of strong atheism and thus agnostic atheism is occasionally a synonym for weak atheism this is similar to the more common confusion of the terms implicit atheism and explicit atheism with strong and weak atheism apatheism often overlaps with agnostic atheism such as with apathetic agnosticism
a fusion of apatheism with strong agnostic atheism atheism in philosophical naturalism many if not most atheists have preferred to say that atheism is a lack of a belief rather than a belief in its own right see for example krueger one nine nine eight p two two two four smith one nine seven nine p one five one six this keeps the burden of proof
on the theist see flew one nine eight four b as the only one making any positive assertions belief also has other connotations that many atheists
may wish to avoid nevertheless some atheist writers identify atheism with the naturalistic world view and
defend it on that basis the case for naturalism is used as a positive argument for atheism see for example thrower one nine seven one harbour two zero zero one nielsen two zero zero one and baggini
two zero zero three see also everitt s discussion of an anti atheist argument against naturalism two zero zero four chapter nine p one seven eight one nine zero according to thrower much atheism can be understood only in the light of the current theism which it was concerned to reject such atheism is relative there is however a way of looking at and interpreting events in the world whose origins can be seen as early as the beginnings of speculative thought itself and which i shall call naturalistic that is atheistic per
se in the sense that it is incompatible with any and every
form of supernaturalism naturalistic or absolute atheism is both fundamentally more important and
more interesting representing as it does one polarity in the development of the human spirit p three four julian baggini argues that atheism can be understood not simply as a denial of religion but as a self contained belief system if it is seen as a commitment to the view that there is only one world and this is the world of nature p seven four for baggini therefore the evidence for atheism is to be found in the fact that there is a plethora of evidence for the truth of naturalism and an absence
of evidence for anything else anything else of course includes god but it also includes goblins hobbits and truly everlasting gobstoppers there is nothing special about god in this sense god is just one of the things that atheists don t believe in it just happens to be the thing that for historical reasons gave them their name p one seven baggini s position is that an atheist does not usually believe in the existence of immortal souls life after death ghosts or
supernatural powers although strictly speaking an atheist could believe in any of these things and still remain an atheist the arguments and ideas that sustain atheism tend naturally to rule out other beliefs in the supernatural or transcendental p three four michael martin one nine nine zero p four seven zero notes that the view that naturalism is compatible with nonatheism is true only if god is understood in a most peculiar and misleading way but he also points out that atheism does not entail naturalism antitheism main article
antitheism antitheism sometimes hyphenated typically refers to a direct opposition to theism in this use it is a form of critical strong atheism antitheism may sometimes overlap with ignosticism the view that theism is inherently meaningless and may directly contradict apatheism the view that theism is irrelevant rather than dangerous however antitheism is also sometimes used particularly in religious contexts to refer to opposition to god or divine things rather than to the belief in god using the latter definition it may be possible or perhaps even necessary
to be an antitheist without being an atheist or nontheist antitheists may believe that theism is actually harmful or may simply be atheists who have little tolerance for views they perceive as irrational strong atheists who are not antitheists may believe positively that deities do not exist but not believe that theism is directly harmful or necessitates opposition history although the actual term atheism originated in one six th century france ideas that would be recognized as atheistic today existed even before classical antiquity epicurus proposed theories that can be classified as atheistic such as a lack of belief
in an afterlife though he remained ambiguous concerning the actual existence of deities before him socrates was sentenced to death partly on the grounds that he was an atheist although he did express belief
in several forms of divinity as recorded in plato s apology this criminal connotation attached to atheistic ideas heresy would remain at varying levels of severity until the renaissance when criticism of the church became more prevalent and tolerated atheism disappeared from the philosophy of the greek
and roman traditions as christianity gained influence during the age of enlightenment the concept of atheism re emerged as an accusation against those who questioned the religious status quo but by the late one eight th century it had become the philosophical position of a growing minority by the two zero th century along with the spread of rationalism and secular humanism atheism had become common particularly among scientists see international survey of contemporary atheism
in the two zero th century atheism also became a staple of the various communist regimes helping return some of the negative connotations of atheism especially in the united states where the term became synonymous with being unpatriotic during the cold war distribution of atheists though atheists are a minority group in most countries they are relatively common in western europe australia new zealand canada in former and present communist states and to a lesser extent in the united states atheism is particularly prevalent among scientists a tendency already quite marked at
the beginning of the two zero th century developing into a dominant one during the course of the century in one nine one four james h leuba found that five eight of one zero zero zero randomly selected u s natural scientists expressed disbelief or doubt in the existence of god the same study repeated in one nine nine six gave a similar percentage of six zero seven this number is nine three among the members of the national academy of sciences expressions of positive disbelief rose from five two to seven two see also the relationship
between religion and science atheism in the united kingdom a poll in two zero zero four by the bbc put the number of people who do not believe in god to be four zero while a yougov poll in the same year put the percentage of non believers at three five with two one uncertain in the yougov poll men were less likely to believe in god than women and younger people were less likely to believe in god than older people in early two zero zero four it was announced that atheism would be taught
during religious education classes in the united kingdom a spokesman for the qualifications and curriculum authority stated there are many children in england who have no religious affiliation and their beliefs and ideas whatever they are should be taken very seriously there is also considerable debate in the u k on the status of faith based schools which use religious as well as academic selection criteria the decision was based on a parliament decision ruling that while questionable in moral standing atheism is
a legitimate religion although atheism is not a religion in any sense this indicates that atheism should be treated the same as theism atheism is championed by many scientists and philosophers in the united kingdom including richard dawkins atheism in the united states a gallup poll in two zero zero five showed five of the us population feel
that god does not exist a poll in two zero zero four by the bbc showed the number of people
who don t believe in god to be larger at one zero however unbelief in god does not imply self identification as an atheist atheists are ostensibly legally protected from discrimination in the united states they have been among the strongest advocates of the legal separation of church and state american courts have regularly if controversially interpreted the constitutional requirement for separation of church and state as protecting the freedoms of non believers as well as prohibiting the establishment of any state religion atheists often sum up the
legal situation with the phrase freedom of religion also means freedom from religion in board of education of kiryas joel village school district v grumet justice souter wrote in the opinion for the court that government should not prefer one religion to another or religion to irreligion everson v board of education established that neither a state nor the federal government can pass laws which aid one religion aid all religions or prefer one religion over another this applies
the establishment clause to the states as well as the federal government however several state constitutions make the protection of persons from religious discrimination conditional on their acknowledgement of the existence of a deity apparently making freedom of religion in
those states inapplicable to atheists these state constitutional clauses have not been tested additionally some state constitutions namely arkansas and south carolina disallow atheists to hold public office although most agree that if challenged these requirements would be ruled unconstitutional under article six of the united states constitution which bans such qualifications civil rights cases are typically brought in federal courts so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance in the
newdow case after a father challenged the phrase under god in the united states pledge of allegiance the ninth circuit court of appeals found the phrase unconstitutional although the decision was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be legally usable without modification in schools in the western united states over which the ninth circuit has jurisdiction this resulted in political furor and both houses of congress
passed resolutions condemning the decision nearly unanimously a very large group consisting of almost the entire senate and house was televised standing on the steps of congress hands over hearts swearing the pledge and shouting out under god the supreme court subsequently reversed the decision ruling that michael newdow did not have standing to bring his case thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge atheism studies and statistics as some governments have strongly promoted atheism whilst others have strongly condemned it atheism may be either
over reported or under reported for different countries there is a great deal of room for debate as to the accuracy of any method of estimation as the opportunity for misreporting intentionally or not a belief system without an organized structure is high also many surveys on religious identification ask people to identify themselves as agnostics
or atheists which is potentially confusing since these terms are interpreted differently by many different people with some identifying themselves as being
both atheist and agnostic additionally many of these surveys only gauge the number of irreligious people not the number of actual atheists or group the two together the following surveys are in chronological order but as they are different studies with different methodologies it would be inaccurate to infer trends on the prevalence of atheism from them a one nine nine five survey attributed to the encyclop dia britannica indicates that the
non religious are about one four seven of the world s population and atheists around three eight the two zero zero one aris report found that while two nine five million u s americans one four one describe themselves as without religion only nine zero two zero zero zero zero four positively claim to be atheist with another nine nine one zero zero zero zero five professing agnosticism
in the two zero zero one australian census one five five of respondents ticked no religion and a further one one seven either
did not state their religion or were deemed to have described it inadequately there was a popular and successful campaign at the time to have people describe themselves as jedi the two zero zero one new zealand census showed that four zero of the respondents claimed no religion in two zero zero one the czech statistical office provided census information on the ten million people in the czech republic five nine had no religion three two two were
religious and eight eight did not answer this suggests that the czech republic is probably the most atheistic country in the world in two zero zero two survey in russia three two self described as
atheist of the five eight self describing as russian orthodox christian four two said they had never been in a church a two zero zero two survey by adherents com estimates the proportion of the world s people who are secular non religious agnostics and atheists as about one four in a two zero zero three poll in france five four of those polled identified themselves as faithful three three as atheist one four as
agnostic and two six as indifferent a two zero zero four survey by the bbc in one zero countries showed the proportion of the population who don t believe in god varying between zero and four four with an average close to one seven in the countries surveyed about eight of the respondents stated specifically that they consider themselves to be atheists a two zero zero four survey by the cia in the world factbook estimates about one two five of the world s population are non religious and about two four are atheists
a two zero zero four survey by the pew research center showed that in the united states one two of people under three zero and six of people over three zero could be characterized as non religious a two zero zero five poll by ap ipsos surveyed ten countries of the developed nations people in the united states had most certainty about the existence of god or a higher power two atheist four agnostic while france had the most skeptics one nine atheist one six agnostic
on the religion question south korea had the greatest percentage without a religion four one while italy had the smallest five
a two zero zero six survey in the norwegian newspaper aftenposten on february one seven saw one zero zero six inhabitants of norway answering the question what do you believe in two nine answered i believe in a god or deity two three answered i believe in a higher power without being certain of what two six answered i don t believe in god or higher powers and two two answered i am in doubt depending on the definition of atheism norway thus has between four nine and seven one atheists still
some eight five of the population are members of the norwegian state s official lutheran protestant church parts of this deviance is due to the fact that all non affilated norwegians were signed into
this church a few years before without being asked and that signing out if they are even aware of being signed in is a time consuming bureaucratic affair yielding no immediate gains statistical problems statistics on atheism are often difficult to accurately represent for a variety of reasons atheism is nonexclusive atheism is a position compatible with other forms
of identity some atheists also consider themselves agnostic buddhist jains or hold other related philosophical beliefs therefore given limited poll options some may use
other terms to describe their identity misrepresentation some politically motivated organizations that report or gather population statistics may intentionally or unintentionally misrepresent atheists survey designs may bias results due to the nature of elements such as the wording of questions and the available response options also many atheists particularly former catholics are still counted as christians in church rosters although surveys generally ask samples of the population and do not look
in church rosters some christians believe that once a person is truly saved that person is always saved a doctrine known as eternal security attitudes toward religion statistics are generally collected on the assumption that religion is a categorical variable as terms such as weak atheism and strong atheism suggest however people vary in terms of the strength of their convictions instruments have been designed to measure attitudes toward religion including one that
was used by l l thurstone this may be a particularly important consideration among people who have neutral attitudes as it is more likely prevailing social norms will influence
the responses of such people on survey questions which effectively force respondents to categorize
themselves either as belonging to a particular relgion or belonging to no religion misunderstanding and external pressure a negative perception of atheists and pressure from family and peers may also cause some atheists to disassociate themselves from atheism misunderstanding of the term may also be a reason some label themselves differently discrimination legal and social discrimination against atheists in some places may lead some to deny or conceal their atheism due to fears of persecution
for example in the two zero th century atheists socialists and communists were persecuted alongside jews by the nazis who lumped all of these terms into one complex issue
or theme the jewish bolshevik world conspiracy as addressed in joseph goebbels one nine three five speech communism with the mask off in which christian civilization national socialism was described as antithetical to jewish communism religion and atheism spiritual and religious atheism although atheistic beliefs are often
accompanied by a total lack of supernatural beliefs this is not an aspect or even a necessary consequence of atheism indeed there are many atheists who are not irreligious or secular these are most common in spiritualities like buddhism and taoism but they also exist in sects of religions that are usually very theistic by nature such as christianity especially in some liberal quaker groups a number of atheistic
churches have been established such as the thomasine church naturalistic pantheists brianism and the fellowship of reason there is also an atheist presence in unitarian universalism an extremely inclusivist religion belief in god as a non being in english believers usually refer to the monotheistic abrahamic god as god in many abstract or esoteric interpretations of monotheism or henotheism god is not thought of as a supernatural being as a deity or god rather god becomes a philosophical category the all the one the
ultimate the absolute infinite the transcendent the divine ground being or existence itself etc for example such views are typical of pantheism panentheism and religious monism attributing anthropomorphic characteristics to god may be regarded as idolatry blasphemy or symbolism by some some theists may not believe in or may even deny the existence of deities as supernatural beings while maintaining a belief in god as so conceived for example the protestant theologian paul tillich described god as the ground
of being the power of being or as being itself and caused controversy by making the statement that god does not exist resulting in him occasionally being labelled as an atheist nevertheless for tillich god is not a being that exists among other beings but is being itself for him god does not exist except as a concept or principle god is the basis of being the metaphysical power by which being triumphs over non being however most atheists who deny the existence of deities as supernatural beings would also deny this and similar
conceptions of god or simply consider them incomprehensible even the broadest definitions of atheism often do not include belief in a conceptual or metaphysical god categorizing this under theism instead judaism in general formulations of jewish principles of faith
require a belief in god represented by judaism s paramount prayer the shema in many modern movements in judaism rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a jew to be the determining
factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of judaism within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a jew to strictly practise judaism as a faith while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist giving rise to the joke q what do you call a jew who doesn t believe in god a a jew it is also
worth noting that reconstructionism does not require any belief in a deity and that certain popular reform prayer books such as gates of prayer offer some services without mention of god rabbi abraham isaac kook first chief rabbi of the jewish community in pre state israel held that atheists were not actually denying god rather they were denying one of man s
many images of god since any man made image of god can be considered an idol
kook held that in practice one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of god thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism some jewish atheists reject judaism but wish to continue identifying themselves with the jewish people and culture see for example levin one nine nine five jewish atheists who practice humanistic judaism embrace jewish culture and history rather than belief in a supernatural god
as the sources of their jewish identity christianity by necessity christianity as a theistic and proselytising religion views atheism as sinful according to psalm one four one the fool hath
said in his heart there is no god according to john three one eight one nine all who reject christianity and presumably its attendant theism do so because their deeds are evil a famous but idiosyncratic atheistic belief is that of thomas altizer his book the gospel of christian atheism one nine six seven proclaims the highly unusual view
that god has literally died or self annihilated according to altizer this is nevertheless a christian confession of faith p one zero two making clear the difference between his position and that of both nietzsche s notion of the death of god and the stance of theological non realists altizer says to
confess the death of god is to speak of an actual and real event not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time
or history but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense p one zero three however many would dispute
whether this is an atheist position at all as belief in a dead god implies that god once existed and was alive atheism typically entails a lack of belief that
any gods ever existed as opposed to not existing currently for further discussion see lyas one nine seven zero other unrelated practitioners of christian atheism may include liberal christian atheists who follow the teaching of jesus
but who may not believe in the literal existence of god in this case however many would dispute whether the atheists in question are truly christians though they certainly are by some of the looser definitions of the word it should be noted that although christianity as a faith
has to be construed as irreconcilable with atheism this is markedly not the case regarding the church institutions which currently are nominally christian indeed the great positivist luminaries in all earnestness encompassed a catholic church which would retain all it s ceremonies and ecclesiastical structures whilst transforming into
a purely atheistic church much in the same way that christianity has co opted the organisational traditions of the native faiths it has encountered around the world and through the ages islam in islam atheists are categorized as kafir a term that is
also used to describe polytheists and that translates roughly as denier or concealer the noun kafir carries connotations of blasphemy and disconnection from the islamic community in arabic atheism is generally translated ilhad although this also means heresy as the sharia punishment for apostasy in islam is death and such apostasy is also widely socially disapproved of atheists as well as converts from islam to other religions in islamic countries and communities frequently conceal their non belief the surveys mentioned above that indicate one
zero zero religious belief in certain islamic countries should be interpreted in light of this fact asian spirituality it is difficult to categorize the eastern thought systems in distinct terms of theism or atheism therefore it should be noted that even the thoughts that would be characterized as atheistic in the western sense often have some theistic tendencies and vice versa carvaka also charvaka was a materialist and atheist school of thought in india which is now known principally from fragments cited by its hindu and buddhist
opponents the proper aim of a carvakan according to these sources was to live a prosperous happy productive life in this world cf epicureanism there is some evidence that the school persisted until at least one five seven eight buddhism is often described as atheistic since buddhist authorities and canonical texts
do not affirm and sometimes deny the following the existence of a creation and therefore of a creator god that a god gods or other divine beings are the source of moral imperatives that human beings or other creatures are responsible to a god or gods for their actions buddhists might also be deemed atheistic in anti buddhist hindu polemic since buddhists opposed the authority of the vedas and of vedic priests and the power of the rituals of vedic religion however all canonical buddhist texts that
mention the subject accept the existence as distinct from the authority of a great number of deities including the vedic deities from the point of view of western theism certain concepts of the buddha found in the mahayana school
of buddhism e g of amitabha or the adibuddha may seem to share characteristics with western concepts of god other schools continue to consider themselves as fundamentally atheistic in the strong sense of the term jainism is also sometimes classified as atheistic since jains
s believe that in the most basic sense god is not seen as a person place or tangible thing but as the ideal state of an individual soul s existence confucianism and taoism
are arguably atheistic in the sense that they do not explicitly affirm nor are they founded upon a faith in a higher being or beings however confucian writings do have numerous references to heaven which denotes a transcendent power with a personal connotation neo confucian
writings such as that of chu hsi are vague on whether their conception of the great ultimate is like a personal deity or not also although the western translation of the
tao as god in some editions of the tao te ching is highly misleading it is still a matter of debate whether the actual descriptions of the tao by lao zi has theistic or atheistic undertones reasons for atheism although not all atheists claim to have a rational justification for their stance a majority of explicit atheists do assert that their stance has a rational basis and there are some especially common reasons given by them philosophical reasons a majority of explicit atheists base their stance on rational or philosophical grounds arguing that their position is based on logical analysis
and subsequent rejection of theistic claims these arguments against the existence of deities consist of a number of different problems with theism chief among these problems is a perceived lack of evidence supporting theistic claims within the
framework of scientific rationalism one arrives at the belief in the nonexistence of god not because of certain knowledge but because of a sliding scale of methods at one extreme we can confidently rebut the personal gods of creationists on firm empirical grounds science is sufficient to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that there never was a worldwide flood and that the evolutionary sequence of the cosmos does not follow either of the two versions of genesis the more we move toward a deistic and fuzzily defined god
however the more scientific rationalism reaches into its toolbox and shifts from empirical science to logical philosophy informed by science ultimately the most convincing arguments against a deistic god are hume s dictum and occam s razor these are philosophical arguments but they also constitute the bedrock of all of science
and cannot therefore be dismissed as non scientific the reason we put our trust in these two principles is because their application in the
empirical sciences has led to such spectacular successes throughout the last three centuries many atheists hold that as their view is merely the absence of a certain belief the only defense that atheism needs is a good offense if theism s
arguments are refuted nontheism as the only alternative becomes the default position as such many atheists have argued against the most famous proofs of god s existence for centuries whether all of the theistic arguments have been refuted is a matter in dispute throughout the centuries theistic philosophers have offered logical arguments in support of god s existence most of these can be divided into four major classes ontological cosmological teleological and moral in general atheists contend that these have been refuted there are also many atheists who attack specific forms of theism as being self contradictory one
of the most common arguments against the existence of a specific god is the problem of evil the problem of evil
is probably the most enduring and the most potent argument atheism has to offer against many varieties of theism christian apologist william lane craig
aptly styled it atheism s killer argument in brief it seeks to establish that the existence of
evil in the world is logically incompatible with the existence of a benevolent god and that it is more reasonable to conclude that god does
not exist than that he does exist but does nothing to stop evil other well known positive arguments include theological noncognitivism
incoherency arguments which seek to prove contradictions within the nature of god atheistic teleological arguments and the transcendental argument for the non existence of god personal
and social reasons as well as atheists with philosophical reasons there are explicit atheists who cite social psychological practical and other reasons for their beliefs some people hold atheistic beliefs on the grounds that it is conducive towards living a better life such as the belief that atheism
is more ethical or useful than theism such atheists may hold that searching for explanations through natural science is more beneficial than doing it through faith moral reasons for atheism include cases where the requirement to do what is right favors being an atheist or at the very least not supporting certain sects or practices of theism those who cannot accept the notion of an evil god must conclude that any immoral religion is necessarily false
practical reasons for atheism include reasons why accepting atheism over theism produces positive overall effects on a person s life arguments that theism promotes immorality often center around the contention that a great deal of violence including war has been brought about by religious beliefs and practices some people are atheists at least partly because of growing up in an environment where atheism is relatively common such as being raised by atheist parents many
people are atheists not because they ve reasoned things out like that but because of the way they were brought up or educated or because they have simply adopted the beliefs
of the culture in which they grew up bbc most atheists contend that the same is true for many believers for instance most of the population in predominantly jewish muslim or christian countries follow the religion that is more prevalent without much questioning christian psychologist paul vitz one nine nine nine argues that many people have psychological reasons for atheism and neurotic psychological barriers to belief in god are of great importance see vitz one nine nine nine and for a similar view
rizzuto one nine nine eight while it is common to point out the psychological reasons for not being an atheist it is
important to note that emotion and feelings play an important role for many people not just theists however an understanding of the psychological origins for belief in a god may contribute to some atheists lack of religious belief see true believer syndrome and psychology of religion historical reasons without even taking into account scientific research some atheists have come to the conclusion that the existence of one or more gods can be dismissed due to historical reasons looking at very old civilizations such as ancient greece and ancient rome people believed in
multiple gods linking each of them to an unexplained physical reality such as
hades the god of the dead helios the god of the sun zeus the god of thunder and poseidon the god of earthquakes these people could not explain a phenomenon using a scientific theory and thus invented a god to explain it from fear of the unexplained in our current times all of these things except one have been explained scientifically
there are no significant group of people believing earthquakes are the direct action of a god shaking the earth the only item from the original gods that is still a near complete mystery is death and as such only one god remains in most modern religions and looking at the various religions death along with afterlife is usually a central topic looking at historical records one can also see how the fears that people have of unexplained phenomenons have been used by various religious leaders both to persecute other religions and to gain more believers it seems
likely to some atheists that if the result of death could someday be explained beyond a reasonable doubt by science the last god would no longer be worshiped by a majority of people just as was the case for every previous
mythical god criticisms of atheism atheists and atheism have received much criticism and opposition chiefly from theistic sources throughout human history opponents of atheism have frequently associated atheism with immorality and evil often characterizing it as a willful and malicious rejection of gods this in fact is the original
definition and sense of the word but changing sensibilities and the normalization of nonreligious viewpoints have caused the term to lose its negative connotations at least in secular cultures the
most direct arguments against atheism are those in favor of the existence of deities which would imply that atheism is simply untrue for examples of this type
of argument see existence of god many common criticisms of atheism are rooted in a misunderstanding of what it is
or an incorrect assumption that all atheists are strong atheists who assert that there is no such thing as god anywhere in the universe ray comfort exhibits this fallacy in the atheist test to say there is no god and
to be correct in the statement i must be omniscient i must know how many hairs are upon every head every thought of every
human heart every detail of history every atom within every rock nothing is hidden from my eyes i know the intimate details of the secret love life of the fleas on the back of the black cat of napoleon s great grandmother to make the absolute statement there is no god i must have absolute knowledge that there isn t one other criticisms of
atheism are based in conceptions that it leads to poor morals or ethics that it is impossible for a person to truly have faith in nothing or that lack of belief in a god is as much or more a leap of faith than belief in a god these criticisms have been answered to the satisfaction of many atheists see also list of atheists strong atheism weak atheism related concepts brights criticism of religion existence

eight nine zero six two six one two zero atheism philosophy of religion agnosticism is the philosophical view that the truth
or falsity of certain claims particularly theological claims regarding the existence of god or gods is unknown unknowable or incoherent some agnostics infer from this that these claims are irrelevant to life the term and the related agnostic were coined by thomas henry huxley in one eight six nine and are also used to describe those who are unconvinced or noncommittal about the existence of deities as well as other matters of religion the word agnostic comes from the greek a without and gnosis knowledge agnosticism focusing on what can be known is an epistemological position
dealing with the nature and limits of human knowledge while atheism and theism are ontological positions a branch of metaphysics that deals with what types of entities exist agnosticism is not to be confused with a view specifically opposing the doctrine
of gnosis and gnosticism these are religious concepts that are not generally related to agnosticism agnosticism is distinct from strong atheism also called positive atheism or dogmatic atheism
which denies the existence of any deities however the more general variety of atheism weak atheism also called negative atheism and sometimes
neutral atheism professes only a lack of belief in a god or gods which is not equivalent to but is compatible with agnosticism critical atheism admits that a god or gods are meaningful concepts but the evidence for them is not in hand so a default position of not believing in them must be
taken in the interim agnostics may claim that it isn t possible to have absolute or certain spiritual knowledge or alternatively that while certainty may be possible they personally have no such knowledge in both cases agnosticism involves some form of skepticism towards religious statements
this is different from the simple irreligion of those who give no thought to the subject variations agnosticism has suffered more than most expressions of philosophical position from terminological vagaries data collection services often display the common use of the term distinct from strong atheism in its lack of disputing the existence of deities agnostics are listed alongside secular non religious or other such categories other variations include strong agnosticism also called hard agnosticism closed agnosticism strict agnosticism absolute agnosticism the view that the question of the existence of deities is unknowable by
nature or that human beings are ill equipped to judge the evidence weak agnosticism also called soft agnosticism open agnosticism empirical agnosticism temporal agnosticism the
view that the existence or nonexistence of god or gods is currently unknown but isn t necessarily unknowable therefore one will withhold judgment until more evidence is available apathetic agnosticism the view that there is no proof either of god s existence or nonexistence but since god if there is one appears unconcerned for the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants the question is largely academic ignosticism the view that the concept of god as a being is meaningless because it has no verifiable consequences therefore it cannot be usefully discussed
as having existence or nonexistence see scientific method model agnosticism the view that philosophical and metaphysical questions are
not ultimately verifiable but that a model of malleable assumption should be built upon rational thought this branch of agnosticism does not focus on a deity s existence agnostic theism the view of those who do not claim to know god s existence but still believe in his existence see knowledge vs beliefs whether this is truly agnosticism is disputed it may also imply the belief that although there is something that resembles or would at least appear to us as a god or gods there remains
doubt over their true nature motives or the validity of the claim to be god rather than superior supernatural being s agnostic spiritualism the view that there may or may not be a god or gods while maintaining a general personal belief in a spiritual aspect of reality particularly without distinct religious basis or adherence to any established doctrine or dogma agnostic atheism the view that god may or
may not exist but that his non existence is more likely some agnostic atheists would at least partially base their beliefs on occam s razor some philosophical opinions among the most famous agnostics in the original sense have been robert g ingersoll thomas henry huxley and charles darwin some have argued from the works of
david hume especially dialogues concerning natural religion that he was an agnostic but this remains subject to debate thomas henry huxley agnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by huxley to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics
about the unconditioned hamilton and the unknowable herbert spencer it is important therefore to discover huxley s own views on the matter though huxley began to use the term agnostic in one eight six nine his opinions had taken shape some time before that date in a letter of september two three one eight six zero to charles kingsley huxley discussed his views extensively i neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man i see no reason for believing it but on the other hand
i have no means of disproving it i have no a priori objections to the doctrine no man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about a priori difficulties give me such
evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else and i will believe that why should i not it is not half so wonderful as the conservation
of force or the indestructibility of matter it is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities i know what i mean when i say i believe in the law of the inverse squares and i will not rest my life and
my hopes upon weaker convictions that my personality is the surest thing i know may be true but the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties i have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non ego noumena and phenomena and all the rest of it too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth
and again to the same correspondent may six one eight six three i have never had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against orthodoxy and i have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school nevertheless i know that i am in spite of myself exactly what the christian would call and so far as i can see is justified in calling atheist and infidel i cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon
of the universe stands to us in the relation of a father who loves
us and cares for us as christianity asserts so with regard to the
other great christian dogmas immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments what possible objection can i who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call matter and force and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds have to these doctrines give me a scintilla of evidence and i am ready to jump at them of
the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude huxley gave coll ess v pp two three seven two three nine the following account so i took thought and invented what i conceived to be
the appropriate title of agnostic it came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the gnostic of church history who professed to know so much about the very things of which i was ignorant to my great satisfaction the term took huxley s agnosticism is believed to be a natural consequence
of the intellectual and philosophical conditions of the one eight six zero s when clerical intolerance was trying to suppress scientific discoveries which appeared to clash with a literal reading of the book of genesis and other established jewish and christian doctrines agnosticism should not however be confused with natural theology deism pantheism or other science positive forms of theism by way of clarification huxley states in matters of the intellect follow your reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other consideration and negatively in matters of the
intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable huxley agnosticism one eight eight nine while a w momerie has noted that this is nothing but a definition of honesty huxley s usual definition goes beyond mere honesty to insist that these metaphysical issues are fundamentally unknowable bertrand russell bertrand russell s pamphlet why i am not a christian based on a speech delivered in one nine two seven and later included in
a book of the same title is considered a classic statement of agnosticism
the essay briefly lays out russell s objections to some of the arguments for the existence of god before discussing his moral objections to
christian teachings he then calls upon his readers to stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence in one nine three nine russell gave a lecture on the existence and nature of god in which he characterised himself as an agnostic he said the existence and nature of god is a subject of which i can discuss only half if one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question the second part of the question does not arise and
my position as you may have gathered is a negative one on this matter collected papers vol one zero p two five five however later in the same lecture discussing modern non anthropomorphic concepts of god russell states that sort of god is i think not one that can
actually be disproved as i think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can p two five eight in russell s one nine four seven pamphlet am i an atheist or an agnostic subtitled a plea for tolerance in the face of new dogmas he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself as a philosopher if i were speaking to a purely philosophic audience i should say that i ought to describe myself as an agnostic because i do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which
one prove that there is not a god on the other hand if i am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street i think i ought to say that i am an atheist because when i say that i cannot prove that there is not a god i ought to add equally
that i cannot prove that there are not the homeric gods in his one nine five three essay what is an agnostic russell states an agnostic thinks it
impossible to know the truth in matters such as god and the future life with which christianity and other religions are concerned or if not impossible at least impossible at the present time however later in the essay russell says i think that if i heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty
four hours including events that would have seemed highly improbable and if all these events then produced to happen i might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence he didn t say supreme or supernatural intelligence these terms are metaphysically loaded for russell then agnosticism doesn t necessarily assert that it is in principle impossible to know whether or not there
is a god moreover an agnostic may think the christian god as improbable as the olympians in that case he is for practical purposes at one with the atheists logical positivism logical positivists such as rudolph carnap and a j ayer are sometimes thought to be agnostic using arguments reminiscent of wittgenstein s famous whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent they viewed any talk of god s as literally nonsense for the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought statements about religious or other transcendent experiences could not
have a truth value and were deemed to be without meaning but this includes all utterances about god s even those agnostic statements that deny knowledge of god s are possible in language truth and logic ayer explicitly rejects agnosticism on the grounds that an agnostic despite claiming that knowledge of god s are not possible nevertheless holds that statements about god s have meaning this position however is valid only in the case of agnostics who define their agnosticism in this fashion ignostics define agnosticism

actinides americium is a synthetic element in the periodic table that has the symbol am and atomic number nine five a radioactive metallic element
americium is an actinide that was obtained by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and was the fourth transuranic element to be discovered it was named for the americas by analogy with europium notable characteristics freshly prepared americium metal has a white and silvery luster at room temperatures it slowly tarnishes in dry air it is more silvery than plutonium or neptunium and apparently more malleable than neptunium or uranium alpha emission from am two four one is approximately three times radium gram quantities of am two four one emit intense gamma rays which creates a serious
exposure problem for anyone handling the element applications this element can be produced in kilogram amounts and has some uses mostly am two four one since it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope americium has found its way into the household where one type of smoke detector contains a tiny amount of am two four one as a source of ionizing radiation am two four one has been used
as a portable gamma ray source for use in radiography the element has
also been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass am two four two is a neutron emitter and has found uses in neutron radiography however this isotope is extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities history americium was first synthesized by glenn t seaborg leon o morgan ralph a james and albert ghiorso in late one nine four four at the wartime metallurgical laboratory at the university of chicago now known as argonne national

definition must not be confused with that of chemical atoms since chemical atoms hereafter atoms are composed of smaller subatomic particles most atoms are composed of three types of subatomic particles which govern their external properties electrons which have a negative charge and are the least massive of the three protons which have a positive charge and are about one eight three six times more massive than electrons and neutrons which have no charge and are about one eight three eight times more massive than electrons protons
and neutrons are both nucleons and make up the dense massive atomic nucleus the electrons form the much larger electron cloud surrounding the nucleus atoms differ in
the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain the number of protons in an atom called the atomic number determines the element of the atom within a single element the number of neutrons may also vary determining the isotope of that element atoms
are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons electrons that are furthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus may also change via nuclear fusion nuclear fission or radioactive decay atoms are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry and are conserved in chemical reactions atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of
chemical compounds molecules are made up of multiple atoms for example a molecule of water is a combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom properties of the atom subatomic particles see main article subatomic particles although the name atom was applied at a time when atoms were thought to be indivisible it is now known that the atom can be broken down into a number of smaller components the first of these to be discovered was
the negatively charged electron which is easily ejected from atoms during ionization the electrons orbit a small dense body containing all of
the positive charge in the atom called the atomic nucleus this nucleus is itself made up of nucleons positively charged protons and chargeless neutrons before one nine six one the subatomic particles were thought to consist of only protons neutrons and electrons however protons and neutrons themselves are now known to consist of still smaller particles called quarks in addition the electron is known to have a nearly massless neutral partner called a neutrino together the electron and neutrino are both leptons ordinary atoms are composed only of quarks and leptons of the first generation the proton
is composed of two up quarks and one down quark whereas the neutron is composed of one up quark and two down quarks although they do not occur in ordinary matter two
other heavier generations of quarks and leptons may be generated in high energy collisions the subatomic force carrying particles called gauge bosons are also important to atoms electrons are bound to the nucleus by photons carrying the electromagnetic force protons and neutrons are bound together in the nucleus by gluons carrying the strong nuclear force electron configuration see main article electron
configuration the chemical behavior of atoms is due to interactions between electrons electrons of an atom remain within certain predictable electron configurations these configurations are determined by the quantum mechanics of electrons in the electric potential of the atom the principal quantum number determines particular electron shells with distinct energy levels generally the higher the energy level of a shell the further away it is from the nucleus the electrons in the outermost shell called the valence electrons have the greatest influence on chemical behavior core electrons those not in the outer shell play a role but it is
usually in terms of a secondary effect due to screening of the positive charge in the atomic nucleus the atomic orbital wavefunctions of a hydrogen atom the principal quantum number is at the right of each row and the azimuthal quantum number is denoted by letter at top of each column an electron shell can hold up to two n two electrons where n is the principal quantum number of
the shell the occupied shell of greatest n is the valence shell even if it only has one electron in the most stable ground state an atom s electrons will fill up its shells in order of increasing energy under some circumstances an electron may be excited to a higher energy level that is it absorbs energy from an external source and leaps to a higher shell leaving a space in a lower shell an excited atom s electrons will spontaneously fall into lower levels emitting excess energy as a photons until it returns to the ground state
in addition to its principal quantum number n an electron is distinguished by three other quantum numbers the azimuthal quantum number l describing the orbital angular momentum of the electron the magnetic quantum number m describing the direction of the angular momentum vector and the spin quantum number s describing the direction of
the electron s intrinsic angular momentum electrons with varying l and m have distinctive shapes denoted by spectroscopic notation in the illustration the letters s p d and f corresponding to l zero one two three describe the shape of the atomic orbital in most atoms orbitals of differing l are not exactly degenerate but separated into a fine structure orbitals of differing m are degenerate but may be separated by applying a magnetic field creating the zeeman effect electrons with differing s have very slight energy
differences called hyperfine splitting nucleon properties the constituent protons and neutrons of the atomic nucleus are collectively called nucleons the nucleons are held together in the nucleus by the strong nuclear force nuclei can undergo transformations that affect the number of protons and neutrons they contain a process called radioactive decay when nuclei transformations take place spontaneously this process is called radioactivity radioactive transformations proceed by a wide variety of modes but the most common are alpha decay emission of a helium nucleus and beta decay emission of an electron decays involving electrons or positrons are due to
the weak nuclear interaction in addition like the electrons of the atom the nucleons of nuclei may be pushed into excited states of higher energy however these transitions typically require thousands of times more energy than electron excitations when an excited nucleus emits a photon to return to the ground state the photon has very high energy and is called a gamma ray nuclear transformations also take place in
nuclear reactions in nuclear fusion two light nuclei come together and merge into a single heavier nucleus in nuclear fission a single large nucleus is divided into two or more smaller nuclei atom size and speed atoms are much smaller than the wavelengths of light that human vision can detect so atoms cannot be seen in any kind of optical microscope however there are ways of detecting the positions of atoms
on the surface of a solid or a thin film so as to obtain images these include electron microscopes such as in scanning tunneling microscopy
stm atomic force microscopy afm nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and
x ray microscopy since the electron cloud does not have a sharp cutoff the size of an atom is not easily defined for atoms that can form solid crystal lattices the distance
between the centers of adjacent atoms can be easily determined by x ray diffraction giving
an estimate of the atoms size for any atom one might use the radius at which the electrons of the valence shell are most likely to be found as an example the size of a hydrogen atom is estimated to be approximately one zero five eight six one zero m twice the bohr radius compare this to the size of the proton the only particle in the nucleus of the hydrogen atom which
is approximately one zero m so the ratio of the size of the hydrogen atom to its nucleus is about one zero zero zero zero zero one if an atom were the size of a stadium the nucleus would be the size of a marble nearly all the mass of an atom is
in its nucleus yet almost all the space in an
atom is filled by its electrons atoms of different elements do vary in size but the sizes do not scale linearly with the mass of the atom their sizes are roughly the same to within a factor of two the reason for this is that heavy elements have large positive charge on their nuclei which strongly attract the electrons to the center of the atom this contracts the size of the electron shells so that
more electrons fit in the only a slightly greater volume the temperature of a collection of atoms is a measure of the average energy of motion of those atoms at zero kelvins absolute zero atoms would have no motion as the temperature of the system is increased the kinetic energy of the particles in the system is increased and their speed of motion increases at room temperature atoms making up gases in the air move
at a speed of five zero zero m s about one one zero zero mph or one eight zero zero km h elements isotopes and ions atoms are generally classified by their atomic number z which corresponds to the number of protons in the atom the atomic number determines which chemical element the atom is for example carbon atoms are atoms containing six protons all atoms with the
same atomic number share a wide variety of physical properties and exhibit the same chemical properties the elements may be sorted according to the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number the atomic mass a atomic mass number or nucleon number of an element is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom of that element so called because each proton and neutron has a mass of about one amu the number of neutrons a z in an atom has no effect on which element it is each element can have numerous kinds
of atoms with the same number of protons and electrons but varying numbers of neutrons each has the same atomic number but a different mass number
these are called the isotopes of an element when writing the name of an isotope the element name is followed by the mass number for example carbon one four contains six protons and eight neutrons in each atom for a total mass number of one four
the atomic mass listed for each element in the periodic table is an average of the isotope masses found in nature weighted by their abundance the simplest atom is the hydrogen isotope protium which has atomic number one and atomic mass number one it consists of
one proton and one electron the hydrogen isotope which also contains one neutron so is called deuterium or hydrogen two the hydrogen isotope with two neutrons is called tritium or hydrogen three tritium is an unstable isotope which decays through a process called radioactivity almost all isotopes of each element are radioactive only a few are stable the elements with atomic number eight four polonium and heavier have no stable isotopes and are all radioactive virtually all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created through stellar nucleosynthesis
and supernova nucleosynthesis most of the elements lighter than uranium
z nine two have stable enough isotopes to occur naturally on earth with the notable exception of technetium z four three several elements that do not occur on earth have been found to be present in stars elements not normally found in nature have been artificially created by
nuclear bombardment as of two zero zero six elements have been created through atomic number one one six given the temporary name ununhexium these ultra heavy elements are generally highly unstable and decay quickly atoms that have either lost or gained electrons are called atomic ions with either positive or negative charge respectively valence and bonding see main article valence electrons and chemical bond the
number of electrons in an atom s outermost shell the valence shell governs its bonding behavior therefore elements with the same number of valence electrons are grouped together in the columns of the periodic table of the elements alkali metals contain one electron on their outer shell alkaline earth metals two electrons halogens seven electrons and various others every atom is most stable with a full valence shell this means that atoms with full valence shells the noble gases are very
unreactive conversely atoms with few electrons in their valence shell are more reactive it is alkali metals are therefore very reactive with caesium rubidium and francium being the most reactive of all metals also atoms that need only few electrons such as the halogens to fill their valence shells are reactive fluorine is the most reactive of all elements atoms may fill their valence shells by chemical bonding this can be achieved one of two ways an atom can either share electrons with other
atoms a covalent bond or it can remove electrons from or donate electrons to other atoms an ionic bond the formation of a bond causes a strong attraction between two atoms creating molecules or ionic compounds many other types of
bonds exist including polar covalent bonds coordinate covalent bonds metallic bonds hydrogen bonds and van der waals bonds atomic spectrum see main article atomic spectroscopy since
each element in the periodic table consists of an atom in a
unique configuration with different numbers of protons and electrons each element can also be uniquely described by the energies of its atomic orbitals and the number of electrons within them normally an atom is found in its lowest energy ground state states with higher energy are called excited states an electron may move from a lower energy orbital to a higher energy orbital by absorbing a photon with energy equal to the difference between the energies of the two levels an electron in a higher energy orbital may drop to a lower energy orbital
by emitting a photon since each element has a unique set of energy levels each creates its own light pattern unique to itself its own spectral signature if a set of atoms is heated such as in an arc lamp their electrons will move into excited states when these atoms fall back toward the ground state they will produce an emission spectrum if a set of atoms is illuminated by a
continuous spectrum it will only absorb specific wavelengths energies of photon that correspond to the differences in its energy levels the resulting pattern of gaps is called the absorption spectrum in spectroscopic analysis scientists can use a spectrometer to study the atoms in stars and other
distant objects due to the distinctive spectral lines that each element produces they are able
to tell the chemical composition of distant planets stars and nebulae not all parts of the atomic spectrum are in visible light part of the electromagnetic spectrum
for example the hyperfine transitions including the important two one cm line produce low energy radio waves when electrons deep inside large atoms are knocked out for example by beta radiation replacement atoms fall deep into the electric potential of the
nucleus producing high energy x rays atoms and antimatter see main article antimatter antimatter can also form atoms composed of positrons antiprotons and antineutrons since antimatter is very difficult to produce and store only a small amount antihydrogen has ever existed on earth this was produced at cern in
the athena and atrap experiments using the antiproton decelerator atoms and the big bang in models of the big bang big bang nucleosynthesis predicts that within one to three minutes
of the big bang almost all atomic material in the universe was created during this process nuclei of hydrogen and helium formed abundantly but almost no elements heavier than lithium hydrogen makes up approximately seven five of the atoms in the universe helium makes up two four and all other elements make up just one however although nuclei fully ionized atoms were created neutral atoms themselves could
not form in the intense heat big bang chronology of the atom continues to approximately three seven nine zero zero zero years after the big bang when the cosmic temperature had dropped to just three zero zero zero k it was then cool enough to allow the nuclei to capture electrons
this process is called recombination during which the first neutral atoms took form once atoms become neutral they only absorb
photons of a discrete absorption spectrum this allows most of the photons in the universe to travel unimpeded for billions of years these photons are still detectable today in the cosmic microwave background after big bang nucleosynthesis no heavier elements could be created until the formation of the first stars these stars fused heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis during their lives and through supernova nucleosynthesis as they died the seeding of
the interstellar medium by heavy elements eventually allowed the formation of terrestrial planets
like the earth history of atomic theory early atomism from the six th century bc hindu buddhist and jaina philosophers in ancient india developed the earliest atomic theories the first philosopher who formulated ideas about the atom in a systematic manner was kanada who lived in the six th century bc another indian philosopher pakudha katyayana who also lived in the six th century bc and was a contemporary of gautama
buddha had also propounded ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world indian atomists believed that an atom could be one of upto six elements with each element having upto two four properties they developed detailed theories of how atoms could combine react vibrate move and perform other actions and had particularly elaborate theories of how atoms combine which explains how atoms first combine in pairs and then group into trios of pairs which are the smallest visible units of matter this parallels with the structure
of modern atomic theory in which pairs or triplets of supposedly fundamental quarks combine to create most typical forms of matter they had also suggested the possibility of splitting an atom which as we know today is the source of atomic energy see indian atomism for more details democritus and leucippus greek philosophers in the five th century bc presented a theory of atoms see atomism for more details the greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes which determined the
physical properties of the material for instance the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth allowing them to slide over each other none of these ideas however were founded in scientific experimentation during the middle ages the islamic golden age islamic atomists develop atomic theories that represent a synthesis of both
greek and indian atomism see islamic atomism for more details older greek and indian ideas were further developed by islamic atomists along with new islamic ideas such as the possibility of there being particles smaller than an atom as islamic influence
began spreading through europe the ideas of islamic atomism along with the older ideas of greek and indian atomism spread throughout europe by the end of the middle ages where modern atomic theories began taking shape birth of modern atomic theory in one eight zero eight john dalton proposed that an element is composed of atoms of a single unique type and that although their shape and structure was immutable atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures chemical
compounds he deduced this after the experimental discovery of the law of multiple proportions that is if two elements form more than one compound between them then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers the experiment in question involved combining nitrous oxide no with oxygen o two in one combination these
gases formed dinitrogen trioxide n two o three but when he repeated the combination with double the amount of oxygen a ratio of one two they instead formed nitrogen dioxide no two four no o two two n two o three four no two o two four no two atomic theory conflicted with the theory of infinite divisibility which states that matter can always be divided into smaller parts in one eight two seven biologist robert brown observed that pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason in one nine zero five albert einstein theorised
that this brownian motion was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about and developed
a mathematical theory around it this theory was validated experimentally in one nine one one by french physicist jean perrin discovery of subatomic particles for much of this time atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter however in one eight nine seven j j thomson published his work proving that cathode rays are made of negatively charged particles electrons since cathode rays are emitted from matter this proved that atoms are made up of subatomic particles and are therefore divisible and not the
indivisible atomos postulated by democritus physicists later invented a new term for such indivisible units elementary particles since the word atom had come into its common modern use study of atomic structure at first it was believed that the electrons were distributed more or less uniformly in a sea of positive charge the plum pudding model however an experiment conducted in one nine zero nine by colleagues of ernest rutherford demonstrated that atoms have a most of
their mass and positive charge concentrated in a nucleus in the gold foil experiment alpha particles emitted by polonium were shot through a sheet of gold rutherford observed that most of the particles passed straight through the
sheet with little deflection striking a fluorescent screen on the other side about one in eight zero zero zero of the alpha particles however were heavily deflected by more than nine zero degrees this led to the planetary model of the atom in which pointlike electrons orbited in the space around a massive compact nucleus like planets orbiting the sun the nucleus was later discovered to contain protons and further experimentation by rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms surpassed that
of the protons it possessed this led him to postulate the existence of neutrons whose existence would be proven in one nine three two by james chadwick the planetary model of the atom still had shortcomings firstly a moving electric charge emits electromagnetic waves according to classical electromagnetism an orbiting charge would
steadily lose energy and spiral towards the nucleus colliding with it in a tiny fraction of a second secondly the model did not explain why excited atoms emit light only in certain discrete spectra quantum theory revolutionized physics at the beginning of the two zero th century when max planck and albert einstein postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in fixed amounts known as quanta in one nine one three niels bohr used this idea in his bohr model of the atom in which
the electrons could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed angular momentum and energy they were not allowed to spiral into the nucleus because they could not lose energy in a continuous manner they could only make quantum leaps between fixed energy levels bohr s model was extended by arnold sommerfeld in one nine one six to include elliptical orbits using a quantization of generalized momentum the ad hoc bohr sommerfeld model was extremely difficult to use but it made impressive predictions in agreement with certain spectral properties however the model was unable to explain multielectron atoms

a full theory of quantum mechanics described by the schr dinger equation together with wolfgang pauli s exclusion principle this allowed study of atoms with great precision when digital computers became available even today these theories are used in the hartree fock quantum chemical method to determine the energy levels of atoms further refinements of quantum theory such as the dirac equation and quantum field theory made smaller impacts on the theory of atoms another model of historical interest proposed by gilbert n lewis in one nine one six had cubical atoms with electrons statically held at

england in geography arable land from latin arare to plough is a form of agricultural land use meaning land that can be and is used for growing crops david ricardo incorporated the idea of arable land into economic theory of the earth s five seven million square miles one four eight zero zero zero zero zero zero km of land more than one two million
square miles three one zero zero zero zero zero zero km are arable most of the arable land on earth is around the largest rivers on earth some examples are the nile river the tigris and euphrates rivers the yellow river the amazon river the ganges and the rhine river these rivers flood regularly overspilling their banks when the flood is over the rivers recede leaving behind rich silt this silt
is excellent fertilizer for crops even if the land is overfarmed and all the nutrients are depleted from the soil the land renews its fertility
when the next flood comes rivers and streams can make desert land arable unarable land on unarable land farming is nearly impossible unless more advanced methods of agriculture are used unarable land usually has no source of fresh water and is often too hot desert too cold arctic
too rocky too mountainous too salty too rainy too snowy or too cloudy clouds block the sunlight plants need for photosynthesis making sunlight into food the plants starve without light starvation and nomadism often exist on unarable land unarable land is sometimes called wastes badlands worthless or no man s land sometimes unarable land can be turned into arable land new arable land makes
more food and can prevent starvation saving lives this also makes the country more self sufficient and politically independent because the country doesn t have to buy food from other countries making unarable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells aquaducts desalination plants planting trees for
shade in the desert hydroponics fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer pesticides reverse osmosis water processors mylar insulation or other insulation against heat and cold digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind and greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas some examples of infertile unarable land being turned into fertile arable land are aran island this island off the west coast of ireland not to be confused with the isle of
arran in scotland s firth of clyde was unarable because it was too rocky the people covered the island with a shallow layer of seaweed and sand from the ocean this
made it arable today they grow crops there israel israel was mostly unarable desert until desalination plants were built on the coast the plants turn salt water into fresh water for farming drinking and washing they created their own large fresh water source some examples of fertile arable land being turned into infertile unarable land
are droughts like the dust bowl of the great depression in the u s turned farmland into desert rainforest deforestation the fertile tropical forests turn into infertile desert land romans destruction of carthage at the end of the punic wars
the victorious romans sowed the earth with salt to symbolize total victory the roman symbol meant that carthage would never grow back their civilization ended crops won t generally grow in salty soil this is why salt water from the ocean can t be used to water crops each year

number one three it is a silvery and ductile member of the poor metal group of chemical elements aluminium is found primarily as the ore bauxite and is remarkable for its resistance to corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation and its light weight aluminium is used in many industries to make millions of different products and is very important to the world economy structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and very important
in other areas of transportation and building in which light weight durability and strength are needed properties a piece of aluminium metal about one five centimetres long aluminium is a soft and lightweight metal with a dull silvery appearance due to a thin layer
of oxidation that forms quickly when it is exposed to air aluminium is nontoxic as the metal non magnetic and non sparking pure aluminium has a tensile strength of about four nine megapascals mpa and four zero zero mpa if it is formed into an
alloy aluminium is about one third as dense as steel or copper is malleable ductile and easily machined and cast and has excellent corrosion resistance and durability due to the protective oxide layer aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the two zero zero
four zero zero nm uv and the three zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero nm far ir regions while in the four zero zero seven zero zero nm visible range it is slightly outdone by silver and in the seven zero zero three zero zero zero near ir by silver gold and copper it is the second most malleable metal after gold and the sixth most ductile aluminium is a good heat conductor which is why it is used to make saucepans bohr
diagram applications whether measured in terms of quantity or value the use of aluminium exceeds that of any other metal except iron and it is important in virtually all segments of the world economy pure aluminium has a low tensile strength but readily forms alloys with many elements such as copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon e g duralumin today almost all
materials that claim to be aluminium are actually an alloy thereof pure aluminium is encountered only when corrosion resistance is more important than strength
or hardness conversely the term alloy in general use today usually means aluminium alloy when combined with thermo mechanical processing aluminium alloys display a marked improvement in mechanical properties aluminium alloys form vital components of aircraft and rockets as a result of their high strength to weight ratio when aluminium is evaporated in a vacuum it forms a coating that reflects both visible light and infrared these coatings form a thin layer of protective aluminium oxide that does not deteriorate as silver coatings do in particular nearly all modern mirrors are made using a thin reflective coating of
aluminium on the back surface of a sheet of float glass telescope mirrors are also coated with a thin layer of aluminium but are front coated to avoid internal reflections even though this makes the surface more susceptible to damage an aluminium can used for the soft drink diet coke some of the many uses for aluminium are in transportation automobiles airplanes trucks railroad cars marine vessels bicycles etc packaging cans foil etc water treatment construction windows doors siding building wire etc consumer durable goods appliances cooking utensils etc electrical transmission lines aluminium
components and wires are less dense than those made of copper and are lower in price but also present higher electrical resistance many localities prohibit the use of aluminum in residential wiring practices because of its higher resistance and thermal expansion value machinery mkm steel and alnico magnets although non magnetic itself

sinking most electronic appliances that require cooling of their internal devices like transistors cpus semiconductors in general have heat sinks that are made of aluminium due to its ease of manufacture and good heat conductivity copper heat sinks are smaller although more expensive and harder to manufacture aluminium oxide alumina is found naturally as corundum rubies and sapphires emery and is used in glass making synthetic ruby and sapphire are used
in lasers for the production of coherent light aluminium oxidises very energetically and as a result has found use in solid rocket fuels thermite and other pyrotechnic compositions aluminium is also a superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of one two kelvins engineering use aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures alloy systems are classified by a number system ansi or by names indicating their main alloying constituents din and iso selecting the right alloy for a given
application entails considerations of strength ductility formability weldability and corrosion resistance to name a few a brief historical overview of alloys and manufacturing technologies is given in ref improper use of aluminium can result in problems particularly in contrast to iron or steel which appear better behaved to the intuitive designer mechanic or technician the reduction by two thirds of the weight of
an aluminium part compared to a similarly sized iron or steel part seems enormously attractive but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a reduction by two thirds in the stiffness of the part therefore although direct replacement
of an iron or steel part with a duplicate made from aluminium may still give acceptable strength to withstand peak loads the increased flexibility will cause three times more deflection
in the part where failure is not an issue but excessive flex is undesirable due to requirements for precision of location or efficiency of transmission of power simple replacement of steel tubing with similarly sized aluminium tubing will result in a degree of flex which is undesirable for instance the increased flex under operating loads caused by replacing steel bicycle frame tubing with aluminium tubing of identical dimensions will cause misalignment of the power train as well as absorbing the operating force to increase the
rigidity by increasing the thickness of the walls of the tubing increases the weight proportionately so that the advantages of lighter weight are lost as the rigidity is restored aluminium can best be used by redesigning the part to suit its characteristics for instance making a bicycle of aluminium tubing which has an oversize diameter rather than thicker walls in this way rigidity can be restored or even enhanced without increasing weight the limit to this process is the increase in susceptibility to what is termed buckling failure where the deviation of the
force from any direction other than directly along the axis of the tubing causes folding of the walls of the tubing the latest models of the corvette automobile among others are a good example of redesigning parts to make best use of aluminium s advantages the aluminium chassis members and suspension parts of these cars have large overall dimensions for stiffness but are lightened by reducing cross sectional area and removing unneeded metal as a
result they are not only equally or more durable and stiff as the usual steel parts but they possess an airy gracefulness which most people find attractive similarly aluminium bicycle frames can be optimally designed so as to provide
rigidity where required yet have flexibility in terms of absorbing the shock of bumps from the road and not transmitting them to the rider the strength and durability of aluminium varies widely
not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy but also as a result of the particular manufacturing process for this reason it
has from time to time gained a bad reputation for instance a high frequency of failure in many early aluminium bicycle frames in the one nine seven zero s resulted in just such a poor reputation with a moment s reflection however the widespread use of aluminium components
in the aerospace and automotive high performance industries where huge stresses are undergone with vanishingly small failure rates proves that properly built aluminium bicycle components should not be unusually unreliable and this has subsequently proved to be the case similarly use of aluminium in automotive applications particularly in engine parts which must survive in difficult conditions has benefited from development over time an audi engineer commented about the v one two engine producing over
five zero zero horsepower three seven zero kw of an auto union race car of the one nine three zero
s which was recently restored by the audi factory that the aluminium alloy of which the engine was constructed would today be used only for lawn furniture and the like even the aluminium cylinder heads and crankcase of the corvair built as recently as
the one nine six zero s earned a reputation for failure and stripping of threads in holes even as large as spark plug holes which is not seen in current aluminium
cylinder heads often aluminium s sensitivity to heat must also be considered even a relatively routine workshop procedure involving heating is complicated by the fact that aluminium as opposed to steels will melt without first turning red forming operations where a blow torch is used therefore requires some expertise since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting aluminium also will accumulate internal stresses and strains under conditions of overheating while not immediately obvious the tendency of the metal to creep under sustained stresses results in delayed distortions for instance the commonly
observed warping or cracking of aluminium automobile cylinder heads after an engine is overheated sometimes as long as years later or the tendency of welded aluminium bicycle frames to gradually twist out of alignment from the stresses accumulated during the welding process for
this reason many uses of aluminium in the aerospace industry avoid heat altogether by joining parts using adhesives this was also used for some of the early aluminium bicycle frames in the one nine seven zero s with unfortunate results when the aluminium tubing corroded slightly loosening the bond of the adhesive and leading to failure of the frame stresses from overheating aluminium can be relieved by heat treating the parts in an oven and gradually cooling in effect annealing the stresses this can
also result however in the part becoming distorted as a result of these stresses so that such heat treating of welded bicycle frames for instance results in a significant fraction becoming misaligned if the misalignment is not too severe once cooled they can be bent back into
alignment with no negative consequences of course if the frame is properly designed for rigidity see above this will require enormous force household wiring because of its high conductivity and relatively low price compared to copper at the time aluminium was introduced for household electrical wiring to a large degree in the united
states in the one nine six zero s unfortunately many of the wiring fixtures at the time were not designed to accept aluminium wire more specifically the greater coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminium causes the wire to expand and contract relative to the dissimilar metal screw connection eventually loosening the connection pure aluminium has a tendency to creep under
steady sustained pressure to a greater degree as the temperature rises again producing a degree of looseness in an initially tight connection galvanic corrosion from the dissimilar
metals increases the electrical resistance of the connection in combination these properties caused connections between electrical fixtures and aluminium wiring to overheat which resulted in several fires as a result aluminium household wiring has become unpopular and in many jurisdictions it is not permitted in very small sizes in new construction however aluminium wiring can be safely used with fixtures whose connections are designed to avoid loosening
and overheating older fixtures of this type are marked al cu and newer ones are marked co alr otherwise aluminium wiring can be terminated by crimping it to a short pigtail of copper wire which can be treated as any other copper wire a
properly done crimp requiring high pressure produced by the proper tool is tight enough not only to eliminate any thermal expansion of the aluminium but also to exclude any atmospheric oxygen and thus prevent corrosion between dissimilar metals new alloys are used for aluminium building wire today in combination with aluminium terminations connections made with these standard industry products are as safe and reliable as copper connections see
also aluminium wire history the ancient greeks and romans used salts of this metal as dyeing
mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds and alum is still used as a styptic further joseph needham suggested finds in one nine seven four showed the ancient chinese used aluminium see notes linked above in one seven six one guyton de morveau suggested calling the base alum alumine in one eight zero eight humphry davy identified the
existence of a metal base of alum which he named see spelling section friedrich w hler is generally credited with isolating aluminium latin alumen alum in one eight two seven by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium however the metal had been produced for the first time two years earlier in an impure form by the danish physicist and chemist
hans christian rsted therefore almanacs and chemistry sites often list rsted as the discoverer of aluminium still it would further
be p berthier who discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it the frenchman henri saint claire deville improved w hler s method in one eight four six and described his improvements in a book in one eight five nine chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium the
american charles martin hall of oberlin oh applied for a patent four zero zero six five five in one eight eight six for an electrolytic process to extract aluminium using the same technique that was independently being developed by the frenchman paul h roult in europe the invention of the hall h roult process in one eight eight six made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper and is now the
principal method in common use throughout the world the hall heroult process cannot produce super purity aluminium directly upon approval of his patent in one eight eight nine hall with the financial backing of alfred e hunt of pittsburgh pa started
the pittsburgh reduction company renamed to aluminum company of america in one nine zero seven later shortened to alcoa the statue known as eros in piccadilly circus london was made in one eight nine three and is one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the washington monument at a time when one ounce cost twice the daily wages of a common worker in the project germany became
the world leader in aluminium production soon after adolf hitler seized power by one nine four two however new hydroelectric power projects such as the grand coulee dam gave the united states something nazi germany could not hope to compete with namely the capability of producing enough aluminium to
manufacture sixty thousand warplanes in four years natural occurrence although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in earth s crust believed to be seven five to eight one it is very rare in its free form and was once considered a precious metal more valuable
than gold napoleon iii of france had a set of aluminium plates reserved for his finest guests others had to make do with gold ones aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over one zero zero years aluminium was when it was first discovered extremely difficult to separate from its ore aluminium is among the most difficult metals on earth to refine despite the fact that
it is one of the planet s most common the reason is that aluminium is oxidised very rapidly and that its oxide is an extremely stable compound that unlike rust on iron does not flake off the very reason for
which aluminium is used in many applications is why it is so hard to produce recovery of this metal from scrap via recycling has become an important component of the aluminium industry recycling involves simply melting the metal which is far less expensive than creating it from ore refining aluminium requires enormous amounts of electricity recycling it requires only five of the energy to produce it a common practice since the early one nine zero zero s aluminium recycling is not new it was however a low profile activity until the late
one nine six zero s when the exploding popularity of aluminium beverage cans finally placed recycling into the public consciousness other sources for
recycled aluminium include automobile parts windows and doors appliances containers and other products aluminium is a reactive metal and it is hard to extract it from its ore aluminium oxide al two o three direct reduction with carbon for example is not economically viable since aluminium oxide has a melting point of about two zero zero zero c therefore it is extracted by electrolysis the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite and then reduced to the pure metal by this process
the actual operational temperature of the reduction cells is around nine five zero to nine eight zero c cryolite was originally found as a mineral on greenland but has been replaced by a synthetic cryolite cryolite is a mixture of aluminium sodium and calcium fluorides na three alf six the aluminium oxide a white powder is obtained by refining bauxite which is red since it contains three zero to four zero iron oxide this is done using
the so called bayer process previously the deville process was the predominant refining technology the electrolytic process replaced the w hler process which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium both of the electrodes used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon once the ore is in the molten state its ions are free to move around the reaction at the negative cathode is al three three e al here the aluminium ion is being reduced electrons are added the aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and
is tapped off at the positive electrode anode oxygen gas is formed two o two o two four e this carbon
anode is then oxidised by the oxygen the anodes in a reduction must therefore be
replaced regularly since they are consumed in the process o two c co two contrary to the anodes the cathodes are not consumed during the operation since there is no oxygen present
at the cathode the carbon cathode is protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells cathodes do erode mainly due to electrochemical processes after five to one zero years depending on the current used in the electrolysis a cell has to be reconstructed completely because the cathodes are completely worn aluminium electrolysis with the hall h roult process consumes a lot of energy but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and or ecologically the world wide average specific energy consumption is approximately one five zero five kilowatt hours per kilogram of aluminium produced five
two to five six mj kg the most modern smelters reach approximately one two eight kw h kg four six one mj kg reduction line current for older technologies are typically one zero zero to two zero zero ka state of the art smelters operate with about three five zero ka trials have been reported with five zero zero ka cells electric power represents about two zero to four zero of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of
the aluminium smelter smelters tend to be located where electric power is plentiful and inexpensive such as south africa the south island of new zealand australia china middle east russia iceland and quebec in canada in two zero zero four china was the top world producer of aluminium suriname depends on aluminium exports for seven zero of its export earnings see also isotopes aluminium has nine isotopes whose mass numbers range from two three to three zero only two seven al stable isotope

four aluminium atoms al one four behaved like an alkaline earth atom the researchers also bound one two iodine atoms to an al one three cluster
to form a new class of polyiodide this discovery is reported to give rise to the possibility of a new characterisation of the periodic table superatoms the research teams were led by shiv n khanna virginia commonwealth university and a welford castleman jr penn state university precautions aluminium is one of the few abundant elements that appears to have no beneficial function in living cells but a few percent of people are
allergic to it they experience contact dermatitis from any form of it an itchy rash from using styptic or antiperspirant products digestive disorders and inability to absorb nutrients from eating food cooked in aluminium pans and vomiting and other symptoms of poisoning from ingesting such products
as rolaids amphojel and maalox antacids in other people aluminium is not considered as toxic as heavy metals but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts although the use of aluminium cookware popular because of
its corrosion resistance and good heat conduction has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium containing antiperspirants are more likely causes of toxicity it has been suggested that aluminium may be linked to alzheimer s disease although that research has recently been refuted aluminium accumulation may
be a consequence of the alzheimer s damage not the cause in any event if there is any toxicity of aluminium it must be via a very specific
mechanism since total human exposure to the element in the form of naturally occurring clay in soil and dust is enormously large over a lifetime care must be taken to prevent aluminium from coming into contact with certain
chemicals that can cause it to corrode quickly for example just a small amount of mercury applied to the surface of a piece of aluminium can break up the aluminium oxide barrier usually present within a few hours
even a heavy structural beam can be significantly weakened for this reason mercury thermometers are not allowed on many airliners as aluminium is a common structural component in aircraft spelling etymology nomenclature history
in one eight zero eight humphry davy originally proposed the name alumium while trying to isolate the
new metal electrolytically from the mineral alumina in one eight one two he changed the name to aluminum to match its latin root the same year an anonymous contributor to the quarterly review objected to aluminum and proposed
the name aluminium aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminum which has a less
classical sound q review viii seven two one eight one two this had the advantage of conforming to the ium suffix precedent set by other newly discovered elements of the period potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium all of which davy had isolated himself nevertheless um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time platinum which had been known to europeans since the one six th century molybdenum which was discovered in
one seven seven eight and tantalum which was discovered in one eight zero two all have spellings ending in um the united states adopted the ium for most of the one nine th century with aluminium appearing in webster s dictionary of one eight two eight however in one eight nine two charles martin hall used the um spelling in an advertising handbill for his new efficient electrolytic method for the production of aluminium despite using the ium spelling in all of his patents filed between one eight
eight six and one nine zero three it has consequently been suggested that the spelling on the flyer was a simple spelling mistake rather than a deliberate choice to use the um spelling hall
s domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling aluminum became the standard in north america even though the webster unabridged dictionary of one nine one three continued to use the ium version in one nine two six the american chemical society officially decided to use aluminum in its publications and american dictionaries typically label the spelling aluminium as a british variant present day spelling in the
english speaking world the spellings and associated pronunciations aluminium and aluminum are both in common use in scientific and nonscientific contexts in the united states the spelling aluminium is largely unknown and the spelling aluminum predominates elsewhere in the english speaking world the spelling aluminium predominates and the spelling aluminum
is largely unknown however in canada both spellings are common due to the multiple influences on the language of its proximity to the united states its british colonial past and the large number of native french speakers outside english the ium spelling is widespread the word is aluminium in french aluminium
in german and identical or similar forms are used in many other languages consequently it is the more common of the two spellings in global terms even though there may be more users of
aluminum in the english speaking world the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in one nine nine zero but three years later recognised aluminum as an acceptable variant hence their periodic table includes both but places aluminium first iupac officially prefers the use of aluminium in its internal publications although several iupac publications use the spelling aluminum chemistry oxidation state one alh is produced when aluminium is heated

is the act of renouncing and resigning from a formal office especially from the supreme office of state in roman law the term was also applied to the disowning of a family member as the disinheriting of a son a similar term for an elected or appointed official is resignation abdications in classical antiquity among the most memorable abdications of antiquity were those of lucius cornelius sulla the dictator in seven nine bc emperor diocletian in ad three zero five and emperor romulus augustus in ad four seven six the british crown probably the most famous abdication
in recent memory is that of king edward viii of the united kingdom in one nine three six edward abdicated the british throne in order to marry american divorc e wallis simpson over the objections of the british establishment the governments of the commonwealth the royal family and the church of england see abdication crisis of edward viii this was also the first time in history that the british crown was surrendered entirely voluntarily richard ii of england for example was forced to abdicate
after the throne was seized by his cousin henry bolingbroke while richard was out of the country when james ii of england after
throwing the great seal of the realm into the thames fled to france in one six eight eight he did not formally resign the crown and the question was discussed in parliament whether he had forfeited the throne or had abdicated the latter designation was agreed upon for in a full assembly of the lords and commons met in convention it was resolved in spite of james s protest that king james ii having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom by breaking the original contract between king and people and
by the advice of jesuits and other wicked persons having violated the fundamental laws and having withdrawn himself out of this kingdom has abdicated the government and that the throne is thereby vacant the scottish parliament pronounced a decree of forfeiture and deposition because the title to the crown depends upon statute

abdicated it was seen as a profound and shocking abandonment of royal duty as a result abdications usually only occurred in the most extreme circumstances of political turmoil or violence this has changed in a small number of countries the monarchs of the netherlands luxembourg and cambodia have abdicated as a
result of old age prince hans adam ii of liechtenstein recently made his son regent an act which amounted to an abdication in fact

church of england the greek motto the truth will set you free is a quotation from john eight three two the anglican communion is a world wide organisation of anglican churches there is no single anglican church since each national or regional church has full autonomy as the name suggests rather the anglican communion is an association of these churches in full communion with each other and particularly with the church of england which may be regarded as the mother church of the worldwide communion
as a result all rites conducted in one member church are recognised by
the others some of these churches are known as anglican explicitly recognising the link to england others such as the american and scottish episcopal churches or the church of ireland prefer a specific name each church has its own doctrine and liturgy based in most cases on that of the church of england and each church has its own legislative process and overall episcopal leadership from a local primate the archbishop of canterbury religious head of the church of england has no formal authority outside that country but is recognised as a symbolic head for
the worldwide communion among the other primates he is primus inter pares or first among equals if the archbishop
of canterbury is compared with other religious leaders such as the pope therefore it is only because of his prominent figurehead role in the media he has no formal authority outside his own province although they are not considered members some non anglican bodies have entered into communion with the anglican communion despite
having non anglican origins and traditions there are also a number of anglican type bodies which separated from a member church of the anglican communion and thus are no longer in communion with the church of england they tend to call themselves continuing churches what holds the communion together the anglican communion has no official legal
existence nor any formal governing structure there is an anglican communion office in london under the aegis of the archbishop of canterbury but it serves merely a supporting and organisational role some have asked what holds the communion together the first attempt at an answer was the chicago lambeth quadrilateral of one eight eight eight proposed by the american episcopal church in
one eight eight six and adopted by the lambeth conference of one eight eight eight it set out four principles for
future christian unity although wider union has not followed the quadrilateral has been useful within the communion itself the quadrilateral according to the wording adopted in lambeth consists of the holy scriptures of the old and new testaments as containing all things necessary to salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith the
apostles creed as the baptismal symbol and the nicene creed as the sufficient statement of the christian faith the two sacraments ordained by christ himself baptism and the supper of the lord ministered with unfailing use of christ s words of institution and of the elements ordained by him the historic episcopate locally
adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of god into the unity of his church this then is the theoretical
basis for unity but what holds it together organisationally in the last few years people have began to refer to four instruments of unity which are effectively symbols to which all the churches of the communion can feel tied in order
of antiquity they are the archbishop of canterbury ab origine the lambeth conference first held in one eight six seven the
anglican consultative council first met in one nine seven one the primates meeting first met in one nine seven nine since each province is legally independent and free to chart its own course the stress on these instruments of unity can easily be imagined in recent years for example some anglicans particularly in africa and asia have been displeased with the american and canadian branches upset by their welcoming attitudes towards homosexuals and by the confident way the changes have been made
the conservatives condemned the action as unilateral and called for wider consultation within the communion before such steps were taken after the north american churches reaffirmed their belief that their actions had been righteous and prophetic they were asked to withdraw their delegates from the two zero zero five meeting of the anglican consultative council although it is not clear under whose authority or by what law they were eventually permitted at the meeting with voice but no vote they have not been expelled or suspended from the communion indeed no church ever has it is unclear how such an
expulsion could ever be carried out since the communion is not a disciplinary entity
but a spiritual construct based entirely on the new testament concept of koinonia provinces of the anglican communion the term province in this context refers to national churches many of which themselves contain several provinces in the sense of groups of dioceses
presided over by an archbishop according to the secretariat of the anglican communion currently the member churches of the anglican communion are as follows the anglican church in aotearoa new zealand and polynesia the anglican church of australia the church of bangladesh the episcopal anglican church of brazil the anglican church of burundi the anglican church of canada the church of the province of central africa the anglican church in

of the anglican communion the anglican communion is a relatively recent concept ever since the church of england which until the two zero th century included the church in wales
broke from rome in the reign of henry viii it has thought of itself not as a new foundation but rather as a reformed continuation of the ancient english church and a reassertion of that church s rights as such it was a distinctly local phenomenon thus the only members of the present anglican communion existing by the late one eight th century were the church of england
its closely linked sister church the church of ireland which also broke from rome under henry viii and the scottish episcopal church which for parts of the one seven th and one eight th centuries was partially underground it was suspected of jacobite sympathies however the enormous expansion in the one eight th and one nine th centuries of the british empire brought the church along with it at first all these colonial churches were under the jurisdiction of the bishop of london after the american revolution the parishes in the newly independent country found it necessary to break
formally from a church whose earthly head was and remains the british monarch thus they formed their own dioceses and national church the episcopal church in the united states of america in a mostly amicable separation at about the same time in the colonies which
remained linked to the crown the church of england began to appoint colonial bishops in one seven eight seven a bishop of nova scotia was appointed with a jurisdiction over all of british north america in time several more colleagues were appointed to other cities in present day canada in one eight one four a bishop of calcutta was made in one eight two four the first bishop was sent to the west indies and in one eight three six to australia by one eight four zero there were still
only ten colonial bishops for the church of england but even this small beginning greatly facilitated the growth of anglicanism around the world in one eight four one a colonial bishoprics council was set up and soon many more dioceses were created in time it became natural to group these into provinces and a metropolitan
appointed for each province although it had at first been somewhat established in many colonies in one eight six one it was ruled that except where specifically established the church of england had just the same legal position as any other church thus a colonial bishop and colonial diocese was by nature quite a different thing from their counterparts back home in time bishops came to be appointed locally rather than from england and eventually national synods began to pass ecclesiastical
legislation independent of england a crucial step in the development of the modern communion was the idea of the lambeth conferences in one eight six seven at the suggestion of the canadian synod the then archbishop of canterbury charles thomas langley invited a great conference of bishops to meet with him at lambeth palace by inviting the bishops of the churches of england and ireland those of the semi autonomous colonial churches and those of the fully
autonomous episcopal church in the united states of america he set a precedent that they all could meet together despite the absence of universal legal ties some bishops were initially reluctant to attend fearing that the meeting
would declare itself a council with power to legislate for the church but it agreed to pass only advisory resolutions these lambeth conferences have been held decennially since one eight seven eight the second such conference and remain the most visible coming together of the whole communion recent controversies recent disagreements over homosexuality have strained the unity of the communion as well as its relationships with other christian denominations see anglican views of homosexuality relationship with the roman catholic church efforts have been underway at least since one nine six six to effect a reconciliation with the roman catholic church

non fiction conan was originally a middle name but he used it as part of his surname in his later years life arthur conan doyle was born in one eight
five nine in edinburgh to charles and mary doyle he was sent to the jesuit preparatory school stonyhurst
at the age of nine and by the time he left the
school in one eight seven five he rejected christianity to become an agnostic from one eight seven six to one eight eight one he studied medicine at the university of edinburgh including a period working in the town of aston now a district of birmingham following his term at university he served as a ship s doctor on a voyage to the west african coast and then in one eight eight two he set up a practice in plymouth he achieved his doctorate in one eight
eight five his medical practice was unsuccessful while waiting for patients he began writing stories his first literary experience came in chambers s edinburgh journal before he was two zero it was only after he subsequently
moved his practice to southsea that he began to indulge more extensively in literature his first significant work was a study in scarlet which appeared in beeton s christmas annual for one
eight eight seven and featured the first appearance of sherlock holmes who was modelled after doyle s former university professor joseph bell interestingly rudyard kipling congratulated doyle on his success asking could this be
my old friend dr joe while living in southsea he helped form portsmouth football club and played as the club s first goalkeeper in one eight eight five he married louise hawkins who suffered from tuberculosis and eventually died in one nine zero six he married jean leckie in one nine zero seven whom he had first met and fallen in love with
in one eight nine seven but had maintained a platonic relationship with her out of loyalty to his first wife doyle had five children two with his first wife mary and kingsley and three with his second wife jean denis and adrian in one eight nine zero doyle studied the eye in vienna and in one eight nine one moved to london to set up a practice as an oculist this also
gave him more time for writing and in november one eight nine one he wrote to his mother i think of slaying holmes and winding him up for good and all he takes my mind from better things in december one eight nine three he did so in order to dedicate more of his time to more important works namely his historical novels pitting holmes against his arch
nemesis professor moriarty they apparently plunged to their deaths together down a waterfall in the story the final problem public outcry led him to bring the character back doyle returned to the story in the adventure of the empty house with the ingenious explanation that only moriarty had fallen but since holmes had other dangerous enemies he had arranged to be temporarily dead also holmes eventually appears in a total of five six short stories and four
doyle novels he has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors following the boer war in south africa at the turn of the two zero th century and the condemnation from around the world over britain s conduct doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled the war in south africa its cause and conduct which justified britain s role in the boer war and was widely translated doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being knighted
and appointed as deputy lieutenant of surrey in one nine zero two he also wrote the longer book the great boer war in one nine zero zero during the early years of the two zero th century sir arthur twice ran for parliament as a liberal unionist once in edinburgh and once in the border burghs but although he received a respectable vote he was not elected arthur conan doyle statue in crowboroughconan doyle was involved in the campaign for the reform of the congo free state
led by the journalist e d morel and the diplomat roger casement he wrote the crime of the congo in one nine zero nine a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in congo he become acquainted with morel and casement taking inspiration from them for two of the main characters of the novel the lost world one nine one two he broke with both when morel who was rather left wing became one of
the leaders of the pacifist movement during the first world war and casement committed treason against britain out of conviction for his irish nationalist views doyle tried unsuccessfully to save casement from the death
penalty arguing that he had been driven mad and was not responsible for his actions doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice and personally investigated two closed cases which led to two imprisoned men being released the first case in one nine zero six involved a shy half british half indian lawyer named george edalji who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals police were dead set on edalji s conviction even though the mutilations continued even after their suspect was jailed it was partially as a result of this case that the
court of criminal appeal was established in one nine zero seven so not only did conan doyle help george edalji his work helped to establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice the story of conan doyle
and edalji is told in fictional form in julian barnes s two zero zero five novel arthur that of oscar slater a german jew and gambling den operator convicted of bludgeoning an eight two year old woman in glasgow in one nine zero eight excited doyle s curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that slater was framed in his later years doyle became involved with spiritualism to the extent that he wrote a professor challenger novel on the subject the land of mist one of the odder aspects of this period of
his life was his book the coming of the fairies one nine two one he was apparently totally convinced of the veracity of the cottingley fairy photographs which he reproduced in the book together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits his work on this topic was one of the reasons that one
of his short story collections the adventures of sherlock holmes was banned in the soviet union in one nine two nine for supposed occultism this ban was later removed doyle was friends for a time with the american magician harry houdini a prominent opponent of the spiritualist movement although houdini insisted that spiritualist mediums employed trickery and consistently attempted to expose them as frauds doyle became convinced that houdini himself possessed supernatural powers a view expressed in doyle s the edge of the unknown houdini was apparently
unable to convince doyle that his feats were simply magic tricks
leading to a bitter public falling out between the two richard milner an american historian of science has presented a case that doyle may have been the perpetrator of the piltdown man hoax of one nine one two creating the counterfeit hominid fossil that fooled the scientific world for over four
zero years milner says that doyle had a motive namely revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics and that the lost world contains several encrypted clues regarding his involvement in the hoax samuel rosenberg s one nine seven four book naked is the best disguise purports to explain how doyle left throughout his writings open clues that related to hidden and suppressed aspects of his mentality sir arthur conan doyle died of a heart attack in one

in latin alumnus is the masculine singular form and alumna the feminine singular form the words are derived from the latin verb alere to nourish and literally mean nourished

in english to describe an intense feeling of internal emotional strife a different but related meaning is attributed to danish philosopher s ren kierkegaard one eight one three one eight five five kierkegaard used the word angst danish meaning dread to describe a profound and deep seated spiritual condition of insecurity and despair in the free human being
where the animal is a slave to its god given instincts but always confident in its own actions kierkegaard believed that the freedom given to mankind leaves the human in a constant fear of failing its responsibilities to god kierkegaard s concept of angst is considered to be an important stepping stone for two zero th century existentialism while kierkegaard s feeling of angst is fear of actual responsibility to god in modern use angst is broadened to include
general frustration associated with the conflict between actual responsibilities to self one s principles and others possibly including god still the angst in alternative music may be more accessible to most audiences than the esoteric tradition of existentialism the term angst is now widely used with a negative and derisive connotation that mocks the expression of
a common adolescent experience of malaise angst in contemporary music angst in contemporary connotative use most often describes the intense frustration and other related emotions of teenagers and the mood of the music with which they identify punk rock

differ from generalized anxiety disorders and panic disorders because there is a specific stimulus or situation that elicits a strong fear response imagine how it would feel to be so frightened by a spider that you would try to jump out of a speeding car to get away from it this is how a person suffering from phobia might feel people
with phobias have especially powerful imaginations so they vividly anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering such feared objects as knives bridges blood enclosed places or certain animals these individuals recognize that their fears are excessive and unreasonable but are generally unable to control their anxiety in addition to specific phobias such as fears
of knives rats or spiders there is another category of phobias known as social phobias individuals with this disorder experience intense fear of being negatively evaluated by others or of being publicly embarrassed because of impulsive acts almost everyone experiences stage fright when speaking or performing in front of a group but people with social phobias become so anxious that performance is out of the question in fact their fear of public scrutiny and potential humiliaton becomes so pervasive that normal life is impossible den boer two zero zero zero margolis stage fright many scientists believe that the

prominent critics of english comic writer p g wodehouse who was captured at his country home in france by the nazis and imprisoned for a year wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment which were broadcast from berlin although the lighthearted broadcasts made fun of the germans milne accused wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country
s enemy wodehouse got some revenge by creating fatuous parodies of the christopher robin poems in some of his later stories in one nine two five milne bought a country home cotchford farm in hartfield east sussex he retired to the farm after brain surgery in one nine five two left him an invalid literary career milne is most famous for his pooh books about a boy named christopher robin after
his son and various characters inspired by his son s stuffed animals most notably the bear named winnie the pooh reputedly a canadian black bear named winnie after winnipeg used as a military mascot by the royal winnipeg rifles a canadian infantry regiment in world war i and left to london zoo after the war is the source of the name e h shepard illustrated the original pooh books using his own teddy growler a magnificent bear as
the model christopher robin s own toys are now under glass in new york the overwhelming success of his children s books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to milne whose self avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who until then had
found a ready audience for each change of direction he
had freed pre war punch from its ponderous facetiousness he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright like his idol jm barrie on both sides of the atlantic he had produced a durable character led and witty piece of detective writing in the red house mystery indeed his
publisher was displeased when he announced his intention to write poems for children and he had never lacked an audience but once milne had in his own words said
goodbye to all that in seven zero zero zero zero words the approximate length of the four children s books he had no intention of producing a copy of a copy given that one of the sources of inspiration his son was growing older his reception remained warmer in america than britain and he continued to publish novels and short stories but by the late one nine three zero s the audience for milne s
grown up writing had largely vanished he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play god help it was simply christopher robin grown up what an obsession with me children are become even his old home punch where the when we were very young verses had first appeared was ultimately to reject him as christopher milne details in his autobiography the enchanted places though methuen continued to publish whatever milne wrote including the
long poem the norman church and an assembly of articles entitled year in year out which milne likened to a benefit night for the author after milne
s death the rights to the pooh characters were sold by his widow daphne to the walt disney company which has made a number of pooh cartoon movies as well as a large amount of pooh related merchandise she also destroyed his papers milne also wrote a number of poems including vespers they re changing guard at buckingham palace and king john s christmas which were published
in the books when we were very young and now we are six his poems have been parodied many times including the books when we were rather older and now we are sixty he also adapted
kenneth grahame s novel the wind in the willows for the stage as toad of toad hall the title was an implicit admission that such chapters as the piper at the gates of dawn could not survive translation to the theater biographies milne s friend frank swinnerton s book the georgian literary scene contains a substantial section about him his son has written several books of autobiography the enchanted places in particular is an account of his

however addiction is often applied to compulsive behaviors other than drug use such as overeating or gambling in all cases the term addiction describes a chronic pattern of behaviour that continues despite the direct or indirect adverse consequences that result from engaging in the behavior it is quite common for an addict to express the desire to stop the behaviour but find himself or herself
unable to cease addiction is often characterized by a craving for more of the drug or behavior increased physiological tolerance to exposure and withdrawal symptoms in the absence of the stimulus many drugs and behaviours that provide either pleasure or relief from pain pose a risk of addiction or dependency terminology and
usage the medical community now makes a careful theoretical distinction between physical dependence characterized by symptoms of withdrawal and psychological addiction or simply addiction addiction is now narrowly defined as uncontrolled compulsive use despite harm if there is no harm being suffered by or damage done to the patient or another party then clinically it may be considered compulsive but within this narrow definition it is not categorized as addiction in practice however the two kinds of addiction are not always easy to distinguish addictions often have both physical and psychological components there is also a lesser
known situation called pseudo addiction where a patient will exhibit drug seeking behaviour reminiscent of psychological addiction however in this case the patients tend to have
genuine pain or other symptoms that have been undertreated unlike true psychological addiction however these behaviours tend to stop as soon as their pain is adequately treated the term dry drunk is sometimes attached to patterns of behavior that persist after an object of dependence and or misuse has been removed from daily living routines this type of behaviour is fairly common in early recovery for those recovering from substance misuse the obsolete term physical addiction
is deprecated because of its connotations in modern pain management with opioids physical dependence is nearly universal but addiction is rare some of the highly addictive drugs hard drugs such as cocaine induce relatively little physical dependence not all doctors do agree on what addiction or dependency is particularly because traditionally addiction has been defined as being possible only to a psychoactive substance for example alcohol tobacco or drugs which is ingested crosses the
blood brain barrier and alters the natural chemical behaviour of the brain temporarily many people both psychology
professionals and laypersons now feel that there should be accommodation made to include psychological dependency on such things as gambling food sex pornography computers work and shopping spending however these are things or tasks which when used or performed cannot cross the blood brain barrier and hence do not fit into the traditional view of addiction symptoms mimicking withdrawal may occur with abatement of such behaviours however it is said by those who adhere to a traditionalist view that these withdrawal
like symptoms are not strictly reflective of an addiction but rather of a behavioural disorder in spite of traditionalist protests and warnings that overextension of definitions may cause the wrong treatment to be used thus failing the person with the behavioural problem popular media and some members of the field do represent the aforementioned behavioural examples as addictions note the diagnostic statistical manual dsm ivr specifically spells out criteria to define abuse and dependence
conditions varied forms of addiction physical dependency physical dependency on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly discontinued while opioids benzodiazepines barbiturates alcohol and nicotine are all well known for their ability to induce physical dependence other drugs share this property that are not considered
addictive cortisone beta blockers and most antidepressants are examples so while physical dependency can be a major factor in the psychology of addiction the primary attribute of an addictive drug is its ability to induce euphoria while causing harm some drugs induce physical dependence or physiological tolerance but not addiction for example many laxatives which are not psychoactive nasal decongestants which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days
in a row and some antidepressants most notably effexor and paxil as they have quite short half lives so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants many non addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them the speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance the frequency
of use the means of ingestion and the individual some alcoholics report they exhibited alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted because of this variation some people hypothesise that physical dependency and addiction are in large part genetically moderated nicotine is one of the most addictive psychoactive substances although three five million smokers make an attempt to quit every year less than seven achieve even one year of abstinence while eating disorders like other behavioral addictions are usually considered primarily psychological disorders they are sometimes treated
as addictions especially if they include elements of addictive behavior sufferers may experience withdrawal or withdrawal like symptoms if they alter their diet suddenly this suggests that some common food substances especially chocolate sugar salt and white flour may have the potential for addiction in addition frequent overeating can also be considered an addiction from the nida research report on nicotine addiction psychological addiction psychological addictions are a dependency of the mind and lead to psychological withdrawal symptoms addictions can theoretically form for any rewarding behavior or as a habitual means to avoid
undesired activity but typically they only do so to a clinical level in individuals who have emotional social or psychological dysfunctions taking the place of
normal positive stimuli not otherwise attained see rat park addiction and drug control legislation most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug like substances under the control
of licensing systems typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates cannabinoids cocaine barbiturates hallucinogens and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs and unlicensed production supply or possession is a criminal offence usually however drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness the substances covered often have very different addictive properties some are highly prone to cause physical dependency whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever also although the legislation may be justifiable on moral or public health grounds it can make
addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment methods of care early editions of the american psychiatric association s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm described addiction as a
physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence recent
editions including dsm iv have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions
as dependency rather than addiction the american society of addiction medicine recommends treatment for people with chemical dependency based on patient placement criteria currently listed in ppc two which attempt to match levels of care according to clinical assessments in six areas including acute intoxication and or withdrawal potential biomedical conditions or complications emotional behavioral conditions or complications treatment acceptance resistance relapse potential recovery environment some medical systems including
those of at least one five states of the united states refer to an addiction severity index to assess the severity of problems related to substance use the index assesses problems in six areas medical employment support
alcohol and other drug use legal family social and psychiatric while addiction or dependency is related to seemingly uncontrollable urges and may have roots in genetic predisposition treatment of dependency is always classified as behavioral medicine early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical detoxification which can include doses of anxiolytics to reduce symptoms of withdrawal in chronic opiate addiction a surrogate drug such
as methadone is sometimes offered as a form of opiate replacement therapy but treatment approaches universally focus on the individual s ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either
interested or not interested in changing treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the
addictive stimulus and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that effect addictive behavior using therapeutic interviews in
an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy addictive sources of
pleasure or relief from pain diverse explanations several explanations or models have been presented to explain addiction the moral model states that addictions are the result of human weakness and are defects of character those who advance this model do not accept that there is any biological basis for addiction they often have scant sympathy for people with serious addictions believing either
that a person with greater moral strength could have the force of will to break an addiction or that the addict demonstrated a great moral failure in the first place by starting the addiction the moral model is widely applied to dependency on
illegal substances perhaps purely for social or political reasons but is no longer widely considered to have any therapeutic value elements of the moral model especially a focus on individual choices have found enduring roles in other approaches to the treatment of dependencies the opponent process model generated by richard soloman states that for every psychological event a will be followed by its opposite psychological event b for example the pleasure one experiences from heroin
is followed by an opponent process of withdrawal or the terror of jumping out of an airplane is rewarded with intense pleasure when the parachute opens this model is related to the opponent process color theory if you look at the color red then quickly look at a gray area you will see green there are many examples of opponent processes in the nervous system including taste motor movement touch
vision and hearing opponent processes occurring at the sensory level may translate down stream into addictive or habit forming behavior the disease model holds that addiction is an illness and comes about as a result of the impairment of healthy neurochemical or behavioral processes while there is some dispute among clinicians as to the reliability of this model it is widely employed in therapeutic settings most treatment approaches involve recognition that dependencies are behavioral dysfunctions and thus involve some element
of physical or mental disease the genetic model posits a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors it is frequently noted that certain addictions run in the family and while researchers continue to explore the extent of genetic influence there is strong evidence that genetic predisposition is often a factor in dependency researchers
have had difficulty assessing differences however between social causes of dependency learned in family settings and genetic factors related to heredity the cultural model recognizes that the influence of culture is a strong determinant of whether or not individuals fall prey to certain addictions for example alcoholism is rare among saudi arabians where obtaining alcohol is difficult and using alcohol is prohibited
in north america on the other hand the incidence of gambling addictions soared in the last two decades of the two zero th century mirroring the growth of the gaming industry half of all patients diagnosed as alcoholic are born into families where alcohol is used heavily suggesting that familiar influence genetic factors or more likely both play a role in the development of addiction the blended model attempts to consider
elements of all other models in developing a therapeutic approach to dependency it holds that the mechanism of dependency is different for different individuals and that each case must be considered on its own merits the habit model proposed by thomas szasz questions the very concept of addiction he argues that addiction is a metaphor and that the only reason to make the distinction between habit and addiction is to persecute somebody szasz one nine seven three the genetic neurobiological model called hypoism read about the science behind this
and its implications at http www nvo com hypoism the scientific argument is at http www nvo com hypoism hypoismhypothesis neurobiological basis the development of addiction is thought to involve a simultaneous process of one increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and two the attenuation or shutting down of other behaviors for example animals allowed the unlimited ability to self administer psychoactive drugs will show such a strong preference that they will forgo food sleep and sex for
continued access the neuro anatomical correlate of this that the brain regions involved in driving goal directed behavior grow increasingly selective for particular motivating stimuli and rewards to the point that the brain regions involved in the inhibition of behavior can no longer effectively send stop signals
a good analogy is to imagine flooring the gas pedal in a car with very bad brakes in this
case the limbic system is thought to be the major driving force and the orbitofrontal cortex is the substrate of the top down inhibition a specific portion of the limbic circuit known as the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is hypothesized to play an important role in translation of motivation to motor behavior and reward related learning in particular it is typically defined as the ventral tegmental area vta the nucleus accumbens and the bundle of dopamine containing fibres that connecting them this system is commonly
implicated in the seeking out and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events such as sweet tasting foods or sexual interaction however ita importance to addiction research goes beyond its role in natural motivation while the specific site or mechanism of action may differ all known drugs
of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens this may happen directly such as through blockade of the dopamine re uptake mechanism see cocaine it
may also happen indirectly such as through stimulation of the dopamine containing neurons of the vta that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens see opiates the euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are
thought to be a direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine the human body has a natural tendency to maintain homeostasis and the central nervous system
is no exception chronic elevation of dopamine will result in a decrease in the number of dopamine receptors available in a process known as
downregulation the decreased number of receptors changes the permeability of the cell membrane located post synaptically such that the post synaptic neuron is less excitable ie less able to respond to chemical signalling with an electrical impulse or action potential it is hypothesized that this dulling of the responsiveness of the brain s reward pathways contributes to the inability to feel pleasure known as anhedonia often observed in addicts the increased requirement for dopamine to maintain the same electrical activity is the basis of both physiological tolerance and withdrawal associated with addiction
downregulation can be classically conditioned if a behavior consistently occurs in the same environment or contigently with a particular cue the brain will adjust to the presence of the conditioned cues by decreasing the number of available receptors in the absence of the behavior it is thought that many drug overdoses are not the result of a user taking a higher dose than is typical but rather that
the user is administering the same dose in a new environment in cases of physical dependency on depressants of the central nervous system such as opioids barbiturates or alcohol the absence of the substance
can lead to symptoms of severe physical discomfort withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines valium family can result in seizures and even death by contrast withdrawal from opioids which can be extremely uncomfortable is rarely if ever life threatening in cases of dependence and withdrawal the body has become so dependent on high concentrations of the particular chemical that it
has stopped producing its own natural versions endogenous ligands and instead produces opposing chemicals when the addictive substance is withdrawn the effects of the opposing chemicals can become overwhelming for example chronic use of sedatives alcohol barbiturates or benzodiazepines results in higher chronic levels
of stimulating neurotransmitters such as glutamate very high levels of glutamate kill nerve cells called excitatory neurotoxicity criticism levi bryant has criticized the term and concept of addiction as counterproductive in psychotherapy as it
defines a patient s identity and makes it harder to become a non addict the signifier addict doesn t simply describe what i am but initiates a way of relating to myself that informs how i relate to others a stronger form or criticism comes from thomas szasz who denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem in many of his works he argues that addiction is a choice and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than say a low
risk lifestyle in our right to drugs szasz cites the biography of malcolm x to corroborate his economic views towards addiction malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his heroine addiction szasz postulates that humans always have a choice and it is foolish to call
someone an addict just becuase they prefer a drug induced euphoria to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle a similar conclusion to that of thomas szasz may also be reached through very different reasoning this is the somewhat extreme yet tenanable view that humans do not have free will from this perspective being addicted to a substance
is no different than being addicted to a job that you work everyday without the assumption of free will every human
action is the result of the naturally occuring reactions of particle matter in the physical brain and so there is no longer room for the concept of addiction since in this view choice is an
illusion of the human experience casual addiction the word addiction is also sometimes used colloquially to refer to something a person has a passion for such addicts include biblioholics chocoholics workaholics see also one two step programs alcoholics anonymous

knowledge is built up not all epistemologists agree that any axioms understood in that sense exist in mathematics an axiom is not necessarily a self evident truth but rather a
formal logical expression used in a deduction to yield further results mathematics distinguishes two types of axioms logical axioms
and non logical axioms etymology the word axiom comes from the greek word axioma which means that which is deemed worthy or fit or that which is considered self evident the word comes from axioein meaning to deem worthy which in turn comes from axios meaning worthy among the ancient greek philosophers an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for
proof mathematics in the field of mathematical logic a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms logical axioms and non logical axioms logical axioms these are
certain formulas in a language that are universally valid that is formulas that are satisfied by every structure under every variable assignment function in colloquial terms these are statements that are true in any possible universe under any possible interpretation and with any assignment of values usually one takes as logical axioms some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language examples in
the propositional calculus it is common to take as logical axioms all formulas of the following forms where phi psi and chi can be any formulas of the language phi to psi to phi phi to psi to chi to phi to psi to phi to chi lnot phi to lnot psi to psi to phi each of these patterns is an axiom schema a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms for
example if a b and c are propositional variables then a to b to a and a to lnot b to c to a to lnot b are both instances of axiom schema one and hence are axioms it can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and modus ponens one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus it can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with modus ponens these axiom schemata are also used in the predicate calculus but additional logical axioms are needed example
let mathfrak be a first order language for each variable x the formula x x is universally valid this means that for any variable symbol x the formula x x can be regarded as an axiom also in this example for this not to fall into vagueness and a never ending series of primitive notions either a precise notion of what we mean by x x or for all what matters to be
equal has to be well established first or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol has to be enforced and mathematical logic does indeed do that another more interesting example is that which provides us
with what is known as universal instantiation example given a formula phi in a first order language mathfrak a variable x and a term t that is substitutable for x in phi the formula forall x phi to phi x t is universally
valid in informal terms this example allows us to state that if we know that a certain property p holds for every x and that if t stands for a particular object in our structure then we should be able to claim p t again we are claiming that the formula forall x phi
to phi x t is valid that is we must be able to give a proof of this fact or more properly speaking a metaproof
actually these examples are metatheorems of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of proof itself aside from this we can also have existential generalization axiom scheme given a formula phi in a first order language mathfrak a variable x and a term t that is substitutable for x in phi the
formula phi x t to exists x phi is universally valid non logical axioms non logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory specific assumptions reasoning about two different structures for example the natural numbers and the integers may involve the same logical axioms the non logical axioms aim to capture what
is special about a particular structure or set of structures such as groups thus non logical axioms unlike logical axioms are not tautologies another name for a non logical axiom is postulate almost every modern mathematical theory starts
from a given set of non logical axioms and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas this turned out to be impossible and proved to be quite a story see below non logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse this does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense for example in some groups the group operation is commutative and this can be asserted with the introduction of an
additional axiom but without this axiom we can do quite well developing the
more general group theory and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non commutative groups thus an axiom is an elementary
basis for a formal logic system that together with the rules of inference define a deductive system examples this section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non logical axioms axioms henceforth a rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms basic theories such as arithmetic real analysis sometimes referred to as the theory of functions of one real
variable linear algebra and complex analysis a k a complex variables are often introduced non axiomatically in mostly technical studies but any rigorous
course in these subjects always begins by presenting its axioms geometries such as euclidean geometry projective geometry symplectic geometry interestingly one of the results of the fifth euclidean axiom being a non logical axiom is that the three angles of a triangle do not by definition add to one eight zero
only under the umbrella of euclidean geometry is this always true the study of topology in mathematics extends all over through point set topology algebraic topology differential topology and all the related paraphernalia such as homology theory homotopy theory the development of abstract algebra brought with itself group theory rings and fields galois theory this list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics including axiomatic set theory measure theory ergodic theory probability representation theory and differential geometry arithmetic
the peano axioms are the most widely used axiomatization of arithmetic they are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about number theory and they allowed g del to establish his famous second incompleteness theorem we
have a language mathfrak where zero is a constant symbol and s is
a unary function and the following axioms forall x lnot sx zero forall x forall y sx sy to x y phi zero land forall x phi x to phi sx to forall x phi x for any mathfrak formula phi with one free variable the standard structure is mathfrak langle n zero s rangle where n is the set of natural numbers s is the successor function and zero is naturally interpreted as the number zero euclidean geometry probably the oldest and most famous list of axioms are the four one euclid s postulates of plane geometry
this set of axioms turns out to be incomplete and many more
postulates are necessary to rigorously characterize his geometry hilbert used two three the axioms are referred to as four one because for nearly two millennia the fifth parallel postulate through a point outside a line there
is exactly one parallel was suspected of being derivable from the first four ultimately the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four
indeed one can assume that no parallels through a point outside a line exist that exactly one
exists or that infinitely many exist these choices give us alternative forms of geometry in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to less than exactly or more than a straight line respectively and are known as elliptic euclidean and hyperbolic geometries real analysis the object of study is the real numbers the real numbers are uniquely picked out up to isomorphism by the properties of a complete ordered
field however expressing these properties as axioms requires use of second order logic the l wenheim skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first order logic any axiom system for the reals admits other models including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger some of
the latter are studied in non standard analysis role in mathematical logic deductive systems and completeness a deductive system consists of a set lambda of logical axioms a set sigma of non logical
axioms and a set of rules of inference a desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete a system is said to be complete if for all formulas phi if sigma models
phi then sigma vdash phi that is for any statement that is a logical consequence of sigma there actually exists a deduction of the statement from sigma this is sometimes expressed as everything that is true is provable but it must be understood that true here means made true by the set of axioms and not for example true in the intended interpretation g del s completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system note that completeness has a different meaning here than it does in
the context of g del s first incompleteness theorem which states that no recursive consistent set of non logical axioms sigma of the theory of arithmetic is complete in the sense that there will
always exist an arithmetic statement phi such that neither phi nor lnot phi can be proved from the given set of axioms there is thus on the one hand the notion of completeness of a deductive system and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of non logical axioms the completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem despite their names do not contradict one another further discussion early mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space and obviously there could only be one such model the idea that alternative mathematical systems might
exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the one nine th century and the
developers of systems such as boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive
them from traditional arithmetic galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted but that the grand parallels between axiomatic systems could be put to good use as he algebraically solved many classical geometrical problems ultimately the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than
the details and modern algebra was born in the modern view we may take as axioms any set of formulas we like as long as they are not known to be inconsistent see also axiomatic system peano axioms axiom of choice axiom of countability axiomatic set theory parallel postulate continuum hypothesis axiomatization list of axioms external links metamath

one nine one nine zero five september one one nine eight one was born berthold konrad hermann albert speer in mannheim germany the second of three sons he is sometimes called the first architect of the third reich he was hitler s chief architect in nazi germany and in one nine four two became hitler s minister of armaments when he had considerable success in reforming and streamlining germany s war production after the war he was tried at nuremberg where he
expressed remorse and was sentenced to two zero years in prison after his release he became a successful author writing a number of semi autobiographical works until his death in one nine eight one from a cerebral hemorrhage early
years although speer originally wanted to become a mathematician when he was young he ended up following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture he began his architectural studies at the karlsruhe institute of technology his decision to study locally instead of at one of the more prestigious institutes was dictated by the inflation of one nine two three in one nine two four when the inflation had stabilised speer transferred his studies to the more esteemed munich institute of technology in one nine two five he transferred again this time to the berlin institute of
technology it was there that he was under the tutelage of heinrich tessenow speer had a high regard for tessenow and when he passed his exams in one nine two seven he became tessenow s assistant his duties as assistant involved teaching seminar classes three days a week although tessenow himself never agreed with nazism a number of his students did and it was they who persuaded speer to attend a nazi party rally in a berlin beer hall in
december one nine three zero speer claims to have been apolitical as a young man nevertheless he did attend the rally he was surprised to find hitler dressed in a neat blue suit rather
than the brown uniform seen on nazi party posters speer claimed to
have been quite affected not only with hitler s proposed solutions to the threat of communism and his renunciation
of the treaty of versailles but also with the man himself
several weeks later he attended another rally though this one was presided over by joseph
goebbels speer was disturbed by the way he had whipped the crowd into a frenzy playing on their hopes although
goebbels performance offended speer he could not shake the impressions hitler made on him the next day he joined the nazi party as member number four seven four four eight one in this same year one nine three one he married margarete weber speer s first major commission as a party member came in one nine three two when karl hanke whose villa speer previously worked on recommended him to goebbels to help renovate the new district headquarters in berlin and later to
renovate goebbels propaganda ministry goebbels was impressed with his work and recommended him to hitler who assigned him to help paul troost renovate the chancellery in berlin speer s most notable work on this assignment was the addition of the famous balcony from which hitler often presented himself to crowds that assembled below speer subsequently became a prominent member of hitler s inner circle and a very close friend to him winning a special place with hitler that was unique amongst the nazi leadership hitler according to
speer was very contemptuous towards anybody he viewed as part of the bureaucracy and prized fellow artists like speer whom he felt a certain kinship with especially as hitler himself had previously entertained architectural ambitions first architect of the reich when troost died in one nine three four speer was chosen to replace him as the party s chief architect one of his first commissions after promotion was perhaps the most familiar of his designs the zeppelintribune the nuremberg parade grounds seen in leni riefenstahl s propaganda
masterpiece triumph of the will in his autobiography speer claimed that upon seeing the original design he made a derogatory remark to the effect that the parade ground would resemble a rifle club meet he was then challenged to create a new design the grounds
were based on ancient doric architecture of the pergamon altar in anatolia but magnified to an enormous scale capable of holding two hundred and forty thousand people at the one nine three four party rally on the parade grounds speer surrounded the site with one hundred and thirty anti aircraft
searchlights this created the effect of a cathedral of light which
referenced columns or as it was called by british ambassador sir neville henderson a cathedral of ice nuremberg was also to be the site of many more official nazi buildings most of which were never built for example the german stadium would have held another four hundred thousand spectators as the site of the aryan games a proposed replacement for the olympic games while planning these
buildings speer invented the theory of ruin value according to this theory enthusiastically supported by hitler all new buildings would be constructed in such a way that they would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins thousands of years in the future such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of the third reich just as ancient greek or roman ruins were symbols of the greatness of their civilizations in one nine three seven speer designed the german pavilion for the one nine three seven international exposition in paris speer s work was located directly across from the
soviet pavilion and was designed to represent a massive defense against the onslaught of communism both pavilions were awarded gold medals for their designs speer was also directed to make plans to rebuild berlin which was to become the capital of a greater germany welthauptstadt germania the first step in
these plans was the olympic stadium for the one nine three six summer olympics designed by werner march speer also designed the new reichs chancellery which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the hall of mirrors in the palace of versailles hitler wanted him to build a third even larger chancellery although it was never begun the second chancellery was damaged by the battle of berlin in one nine four five and was eventually demolished by the soviet occupiers
after the war speer left with hitler and arno breker in paris june two three one nine four zero almost none of the other buildings
planned for berlin were ever built berlin was to be reorganized along a central three mile five km long avenue at the north end speer planned to build the volkshalle an enormous domed building based on st peter s basilica in rome the dome of the building would have been impractically large it would be over seven hundred feet over two hundred meters high and eight hundred feet three hundred meters in diameter sixteen times larger than the dome of st peter s at the southern end of
the avenue would be an arch based on the arc de triomphe in paris but again much larger it would be almost four hundred feet one two zero m high and the arc de triomphe would have been able to fit inside its opening the outbreak of world war ii in one nine three nine led to the abandonment of these plans during his involvement in the rebuilding of berlin he was allegedly responsible for the forced evictions of jews from their houses to make room for his grand plans and for re
housing german citizens affected by this work he was also listed as being present at the one nine four three posen conference a charge speer later contested by saying that he had in fact left early speer did have an architectural rival hermann giesler whom hitler also favored there were frequent clashes between the two in regard to architectural matters and in closeness to hitler minister of armaments
hitler was always a strong supporter of speer in part because of hitler s own frustrated artistic and architectural visions a strong affinity developed between
hitler and the ambitious young architect early in their professional relationship for speer serving as architect for the head of the german state and being given virtual carte blanche as to expenses presented a tremendous opportunity for hitler speer seemed to be capable of translating hitler s grandiose visions into tangible designs which expressed what hitler felt were national socialist principles after minister of armaments and war production fritz todt was killed in an airplane crash in
one nine four two hitler appointed speer as his successor in all of his posts
hitler s affinity for speer and the architect s efficiency and avoidance of party squabbling are believed to have been considerations in speer s promotion in his autobiography speer recounts that the power hungry but lazy hermann g ring raced to hitler s headquarters upon word of todt s death hoping to claim the office hitler instead presented g ring with the fait accompli of speer s appointment faced with this new responsibility speer tried to
put the german economy on a war footing comparable to that of the allied nations but found himself incessantly hindered by party politics and lack of cooperation from the nazi hierarchy nevertheless by slowly centralizing almost all industry control and cutting through the dense bureaucracy he succeeded in multiplying war production four times over the next two and a half years with it actually reaching its peak in one nine four four during the height of the allied strategic bombing campaign another big hurdle in his way was the nazi policy excluding women
from factory work a serious hindrance in war production and a problem unknown to germany s enemies who all made full use of the female workforce to fill this gap speer made heavy use of foreign labor a considerable portion of it forced labor speer was considered one of the more rational members of the nazi hierarchy in contrast to the raging hitler grotesque g ring fanatical goebbels and perverse himmler speer s name was found on the list of members of a post hitler government envisioned by the july two zero plot to
kill hitler however the list had an annotation if possible by his name which speer credits with helping save his life from the extensive purges that followed the scheme s failure by his own account speer considered assassinating hitler in one nine four five by releasing poison gas into the air intake vent on the f hrerbunker but backed down for a number of reasons
independent evidence for this is sparse some credit his revelation of this
plan at the nuremberg trials as being pivotal in sparing him the death sentence which the soviets had pushed for hitler continued to consider speer trustworthy though this trust waned near the war s end as speer at considerable risk campaigned clandestinely to prevent the implementation of hitler s scorched earth policy on both german soil and occupied territories speer worked in association with general gotthard heinrici whose troops fighting in the
east retreated to the american held lines and surrendered there instead of following hitler s orders to make what would have been a suicidal effort to hold off the soviets from berlin speer even confessed to hitler shortly before the dictator s suicide that he had disobeyed and indeed actively hindered hitler s scorched earth decree according to speer s autobiography speer visited the f hrerbunker towards the end and stated gently but bluntly to hitler that the war
was lost and expressed his opposition to the systematic destruction of germany while reaffirming his affection and faith in hitler this conversation it is said
brought hitler to tears in disfavor speer was excluded from the new cabinet hitler outlined in his final political testament where speer was to be replaced by his
subordinate karl otto saur after the war speer at the nuremberg trials nuremberg trials immediately after the war there seemed to be little indication that speer would be charged with war crimes speer traveled unprotected and openly participated in the so called flensburg government for weeks in the presence of allied officers upon request he actually held a series of widely attended lectures for officials of the allied occupying powers on various topics including the mistakes made by the nazi government in industrial and economic affairs although he never during these lectures spoke about slave
labor and the effectiveness of the allied strategic bombing campaigns some journalists and spectators even expected that speer would be appointed by the occupying powers to help restore germany s economy however any such speculation ended when after one of these
lectures he was arrested and sent to nuremberg for trial at the nuremberg trials after the war speer was one of the few officials to express remorse and plead guilty but was sentenced to two zero years imprisonment in spandau prison west berlin largely for his use of slave labor at the trials the prosecution introduced as evidence a photograph
of speer visiting the mauthausen concentration camp where he is clearly shown surrounded by emaciated prisoners the prosecution claimed this proved speer was well aware of the holocaust however speer held that he was only given a v i p tour of the concentration camp meaning he was never shown
the more vile side of the camp s purpose according to interviews after his imprisonment as well as his memoirs speer adopted a see no evil attitude towards the nazi atrocities for example through one of his friends karl hanke he learned of auschwitz and the large number of deaths taking place there he then purposely avoided visiting the camp or trying to get more information on what was taking place in his autobiography he claims that he had
no direct involvement or knowledge of the holocaust although he faults himself for blinding himself to its existence he certainly was aware at least of harsh conditions for the slave labor
and some critics believe that his books understate his role in the atrocities of the era newly released documents suggest that speer knew a lot more about the atrocities than he was telling but hard evidence for
that remains very thin one problem with assessments of speer s complicity in the holocaust comes from his status in post war germany he became a symbol for people who were involved with the nazi regime yet did not have or claimed not to have had
any part in the regime s atrocities even today german historians such as joachim fest tend to have a high opinion of him while non german historians take a lower view as film director heinrich breloer remarked in the above linked article speer created a market for people who said believe me i didn t know anything about the holocaust just look at the f hrer s friend he didn t know about it either imprisonment main article spandau prison his
time in prison painstakingly documented in his secret prison diary which was later released as the spandau diaries was described as consisting mainly of a mind numbing and pedantically enforced daily routine incessant petty personal rivalry between the seven prisoners a pervasive and bloated prison bureaucracy and the passing of many false hopes of premature release after some time speer and most of the others had established secret lines of communication to the outside world via sympathetic prison staff speer made full use of this by amongst other things writing innumerable letters to his family which were restricted to
one outgoing page per month under official regulation and even having money spent on his behalf from a special bank account for a variety of benign purposes speer as recounted in his diary made a deliberate effort to make as productive use of his time as possible in the first decade this took the form of putting on paper the first draft of his tell all memoirs an act speer considered to be
his duty to history and his people he being the sole surviving member of hitler s inner circle and in possession of knowledge and a degree of objectivity that no other had as the prison directors both forbade the writing of a memoir and recorded each sheet of paper given to the prisoners he wrote much of his memoir secretly on toilet paper tobacco wrappings
and any other material he could get his hands on and then had the pages systematically smuggled out all the while speer devoted much of his energy and time towards reading books from the prison library which was organized by fellow prisoner and ex grand admiral erich raeder speer was more so than the others a voracious reader and he completed well over five zero zero books in the first three years alone his tastes ranged from greek drama to famous
plays to architectural books and journals partly from which he collected information for a book he intended to write on the history and function of windows in architecture later speer took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work heretofore the garden was divided up into small personal plots for each prisoner with the produce of the garden
being used in the prison kitchen when regulations began to slacken in this regard speer was allowed to build an ambitious garden complete with a meandering path rock garden and a wide variety of flowers the garden was even humorously centered around a north south axis which was to be the core design element of speer and hitler s new berlin speer then took up a walking tour of the world by ordering geography and travel books from the local library and walking laps in the prison garden visualizing his journey meticulously calculating every metre traveled he began in
northern germany went through the balkans persia india and siberia then crossed the bering strait and continued southwards finally ending his sentence in central mexico release his release from prison in one nine six six was a world wide media event he then revised and published the several semi autobiographical books he had begun in prison his books most notably inside the third reich and the spandau diaries which were secretly written during his incarceration and systematically smuggled out provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of

ray flowers like dandelions genus taraxacum to all disc flowers like pineapple weeds the composite nature of the inflorescences of these plants led early taxonomists to call this family the compositae although the rules governing naming conventions for plant families state that the name should come from the type genus in this case aster and thus asteraceae however the long

typically about one micrometre across but may extend to macroscopic lengths the longest axons in the human body for example are those of the sciatic nerve which run from the base of the spine to the big toe of each foot these single cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer in vertebrates the axons of many neurons are sheathed in myelin which is formed by either of two types of glial cells schwann cells ensheathing peripheral
neurons and oligodendrocytes insulating those of the central nervous system along myelinated nerve fibers gaps in the sheath known as nodes of ranvier occur at evenly spaced intervals enabling an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called saltation the demyelination of axons is what causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease multiple sclerosis the axons of some neurons branch to form axon collaterals along

morpheme twice in a row rather anomalous in terms of arabic grammar the more proper arabic form might be abd el hazred or simply abdul hazred with a single definite article although these are still anomalous as hazred is not one of the nine nine names of god in arabic translations
his name has appeared as abdullah al a red while this arabic alphabet spelling of alhazred has no real meaning in
the arabic language it is reminiscent of the verb root meaning to forbid according to lovecraft s history of the necronomicon written one nine two seven first published one nine three eight alhazred was a mad poet of sana in yemen who is said to have flourished during the period of the ommiade caliphs
circa seven zero zero a d he visited the ruins of babylon and the subterranean secrets of memphis and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of arabia the roba el khaliyeh or empty space of the ancients and dahna or crimson desert of the modern arabs which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it in his last years alhazred dwelt in damascus in seven three zero while still
living in damascus alhazred supposedly authored in arabic a book of ultimate evil al azif which would later become known as the necronomicon those who have any dealings with the necronomicon usually come to an unpleasant end and alhazred was no exception again according to lovecraft of his final death or disappearance seven three eight a d many terrible and conflicting things are told he is said by ibn khallikan one three th century
biographer to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright frozen witnesses of his madness many things are told he claimed to have seen fabulous irem or city of pillars and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain nameless desert town the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind
he was only an indifferent moslem worshipping unknown entities whom he called yog sothoth and cthulhu august derleth later made alterations to the biography of alhazared one change was redating alhazared s death to seven three one
derleth further wrote on the final fate of alhazred in his story the keeper of the key first published in may one nine
five one in this story dr laban shrewsbury a recurring derleth character and his assistant at the time naylan colum discovered alhazred s burial site more specifically they were heading a caravan from salalah oman and crossed the border into yemen there they found the unexplored desert area the necronomicon names as roba el ehaliyeh or roba el khaliyeh perhaps a form of rabia al awliya which again is not proper arabic but could be an allusion to the sufi saint rabia pure conjecture more likely it refers the empty quarter or rub al khali
at the center of the area they discovered the nameless city a domain of hastur shrewsbury as an
old agent of hastur and devoted enemy of his half brother cthulhu crossed its gates in search of alhazred s burial site he indeed found the gate of alhazred s burial chamber and learned of his fate alhazred was kidnapped in damascus and brought to the nameless city where he had earlier studied and learned some of necronomicon s secrets as punishment for his betrayal of their secrets alhazred was tortured then they blinded him and severed his tongue and finally executed him the entrance to the chamber warned against disturbing him but
shrewbury proceeded in entering the chamber and opening the sarcophagus though only rugs bones and dust remained of alhazred the sarcophagus also contained an incomplete personal copy of the necronomicon written in the arabic alphabet then shrewsbury used necromancy to recall alhazred s spirit and ordered it to draw a map of the world as he knew it after obtaining the map which revealed the location of r lyeh and other secret places shrewsbury finally let alhazred return to his eternal rest pop culture roberta williams used the name abdul alhazred as the name of the

correspondence between lovelace and babbage indicate that he wrote all of the programs in the notes appended to the menebrea translation
her prose acknowledged some possibilities of the machine which babbage never published such as speculating that the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent ada lovelace died at three six after being bled to death by her physicians who were trying to treat her uterine cancer thus she died ironically not only at the same age as her father did but even of the same cause the mistaken custom of bloodletting

computer science the ambient calculus is a process calculus devised by luca cardelli and andrew d gordon in one nine nine eight and used to describe and theorise about
concurrent systems that include mobility here mobility means both computation carried out on mobile devices
i e networks that have a dynamic topology and mobile computation i e executable code that is able to move around the network the ambient calculus provides a unified framework for modeling both kinds of mobility it is used to model interactions in such concurrent systems as the internet since its inception the ambient calculus has grown into a family of closely related ambient calculi informal description ambients the fundamental primitive of the ambient calculus is the ambient an ambient is informally defined as a
bounded place in which computation can occur the notion of boundaries is considered key to representing mobility since a boundary defines a contained computational agent that can be moved in its entirety examples of ambients include a web page bounded by a file a virtual address space bounded by an addressing range a unix file system bounded within a physical volume a single data object bounded by self a laptop bounded by its case and data ports the key
properties of ambients within the ambient calculus are ambients have names which are used to control access to the ambient ambients can be nested inside other ambients representing for example administrative domains ambients can be moved as a whole operations computation is represented as the crossing of boundaries i e the movement of ambients there are three basic operations or capabilities on ambients in m p instructs the surrounding ambient to enter some sibling ambient m and then proceed as p out m p instructs the surrounding ambient to exit its
parent ambient m open m p instructs the surrounding ambient to dissolve the boundary of an ambient m located at the same level the ambient calculus provides a reduction semantics that formally defines what the results of these operations are communication within i e local to an ambient is anonymous and asynchronous output actions release names or capabilities into the surrounding ambient input actions capture a value from the ambient and bind it to a variable non local i o can be represented in terms of these local communications actions by a variety
of means one approach is to use mobile messenger agents that carry a message from one ambient to another using the capabilities described above another approach is to emulate channel based communications by modeling a channel in terms of ambients and operations on those ambients the three basic ambient primitives namely in out and open are expressive enough to simulate name passing channels in the calculus criticisms some people believe that the synchronous nature of the three
ambient actions in out and open may make it difficult to adopt the ambient calculus as the programming language core for mobile and distributed computing a counter argument to this criticism is that the ambient calculus is not intended to act as a language core but rather to provide general capabilities for formally modelling and analyzing complex

great recumbent folds or nappes that rose out of what had become the tethys sea and pushed northward often breaking and sliding one over the other to form gigantic thrust faults crystalline rocks which are exposed in the higher central regions are the rocks forming mont blanc the matterhorn and high peaks

temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the wild herbaceous vegetation this limit usually lies about one two zero zero m above the sea on the north side of the alps but on the southern slopes it often rises to one five zero zero m sometimes even to one seven zero zero m it must not be
supposed that this region is always marked by the presence of the characteristic trees the interference of man has in many districts almost removed them and excepting the beech forests of the austrian alps a considerable wood of deciduous trees is rare in many districts where such woods once existed their place has been occupied by the scots pine and norway

completed his licence de philosophie ba in one nine three five in may of one nine three six he successfully presented his thesis on plotinus n o platonisme et pens e chr tienne for his dipl me d tudes sup rieures roughly equivalent to an m a by thesis camus joined the french communist party in one nine three four apparently for concern over the political situation in spain which eventually resulted in the spanish civil war rather than support
for marxist leninist doctrine in one nine three six the independence minded algerian communist party pca was founded camus joined the activities of le parti du peuple alg rien which
got him into trouble with his communist party comrades as a result he was denounced as trotskyite which did not endear him to stalinist communism in one nine three four he married simone hie a morphine addict but the marriage ended due to simone s infidelity in one nine three five he founded th tre du travail worker

faure a pianist and mathematician francine gave birth to twins catherine and jean camus on september five th one nine four five also in this year camus began to work for paris soir magazine in the first stage of world war ii the so called phony war stage camus was a pacifist however he was in paris to witness how the wehrmacht took over
on december one five one nine four one camus witnessed the execution of gabriel peri an event which camus later said crystallized his revolt against the germans afterwards he moved to bordeaux alongside the rest of the staff of paris soir in this year he finished his first books the stranger and the myth of sisyphus he returned briefly to oran algeria in one nine four two literary career during the war camus joined the french
resistance cell combat which published an underground newspaper of the same name this group worked against the nazis and in it camus assumed the moniker beauchard camus became the paper s editor in one nine four three and when the allies liberated paris camus reported on the last of the fighting he eventually resigned from combat in one nine four seven when it became a commercial
paper it was here that he became acquainted with jean paul sartre albert camus after the war camus became one member of sartre s entourage and frequented caf de flore on the boulevard st germain in paris camus also toured the united states to lecture about french existentialism although he leaned left wing politics politically his strong criticisms of communist doctrine did not win
him any friends in the communist parties and eventually also alienated sartre in one nine four nine his tuberculosis returned and he lived in seclusion for two years in one nine five one he published the rebel a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which made clear his rejection of communism the book upset many of his colleagues and contemporaries in france and led to the final split with sartre the dour reception depressed him and he began instead to translate plays camus s most significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of
the absurd the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither which he explained in the
myth of sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works such as the plague some would argue that camus is better described not as an existentialist a label he would have rejected but as an absurdist in the one nine five zero s camus devoted his efforts to human rights in one nine five two he resigned from his work for unesco when the un accepted spain as a member
under the leadership of general franco in one nine five three he was one of the few leftists who criticized soviet methods to crush a worker s strike in east berlin in one nine five six he protested similar methods in hungary he maintained his pacifism and resistance to capital punishment everywhere in the world one of his most significant contributions was an essay collaboration with koestler the writer intellectual and founder of the league against capital punishment when the algerian war of independence began
in one nine five four it presented a moral dilemma for camus he identified with pied noirs and defended the
french government on the grounds that revolt of its north african colony was really an integral part of the new arab imperialism led by egypt and an anti western offensive orchestrated by russia to encircle europe and isolate the united states actuelles iii chroniques algeriennes one nine three nine one nine five eight although favouring greater algerian autonomy or even federation though not full scale independence he believed that the pied noirs and arabs could co exist during the war he advocated civil truce that would
spare the civilians which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish behind the scenes he began to work clandestinely for imprisoned algerians who faced the death penalty from one nine five five to one nine five six
camus wrote for l express in one nine five seven he was awarded the nobel prize in literature officially not for his novel the fall published the previous year but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay r flexions
sur la guillotine when he spoke to students at the university of stockholm he defended his apparent inactivity in the algerian question and stated that he was worried what could happen to
his mother who still lived in algeria this led to further ostracism by french left wing intellectuals camus died on january four one nine six zero in a car accident near sens in a place named
le grand frossard in the small town of villeblevin ironically camus had uttered a remark earlier in his life that the most absurd way to die would be in a car accident the monument to the french writer and philosopher albert camus one nine one three one nine six zero built in the small town of villeblevin france where he died in a car crash on january four one nine six zero the bronze plaque on the monument to the french writer and philosopher albert camus one nine one three one nine

the novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in algeria and was published in one nine nine five summary of absurdism albert camus gravestone many writers have written on the absurd each with
his or her own interpretation of what the absurd actually is and their own ideas on the importance of the absurd for example sartre does little more than acknowledge it while kierkegaard bases the existence of the god on the fact of the absurd camus was not the originator of absurdism and regretted the continued reference to him as a philosopher of the absurd he shows less and less interest in the absurd shortly after publishing le mythe de sisyphe the myth of sisyphus to distinguish camus s ideas
of the absurd from those of other philosophers people sometimes refer to the paradox of the absurd when referring to camus s absurd his early thoughts on the absurd
appeared in his first collection of essays l envers et l endroit the wrong side and the right side in one nine three seven absurd themes appeared with more sophistication in his second collection of essays noces nuptials in one nine three eight in these essays camus does not offer a philosophical account of the absurd or even a definition rather he reflects on the experience of the absurd in one nine four two he published the story of a man living an absurd life as l tranger the stranger outsider
and in the same year releases le mythe de sisyphe the myth of sisyphus a literary essay on the absurd he had also written a play about a roman emperor caligula pursuing an absurd logic however the play was not performed until one nine four five the turning point in camus s attitude to the absurd occurs
in a collection of letters to a fictitious german friend published in the newspaper combat camus ideas on the absurd in the essays camus presented us with dualisms happiness and sadness dark and light life and death etc he wanted us to face up to the fact that happiness is fleeting and that we will die he did this not to be morbid but so we can love life and enjoy our happiness when it occurs in le myth this dualism became a paradox we value our lives and existence so greatly but at the same
time we know we will eventually die and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless whilst we can live with a dualism i can accept periods of unhappiness because i know i will also experience happiness to come we cannot live with the paradox i think my life is of great importance but i also think it is meaningless in le myth camus was interested in how we experience the absurd and how we live with it our life
must have meaning for us to value it if we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value should we kill ourselves meursault the absurdist hero of l tranger is a murderer who is executed for
his crimes caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and
is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about however camus while obviously suggesting that caligula s absurd reasoning is wrong exalts meursault as the only messiah we deserve le mythe de sisyphe raises questions it cannot satisfactorily answer camus work on the
absurd was intended to promote a public debate his various offerings entice us to think about the absurd and offer our own contribution concepts such as cooperation joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to camus in the essay enigma camus expressed his frustration at being labeled a philosopher of the absurd none of
his previous work was intended to be a definitive account of his thoughts on the absurd although the le mythe de sisyphe is often mistaken as such camus made a significant contribution to our understanding of the absurd but was not himself an absurdist if nothing had any meaning you would be right but there is something that still has a meaning second letter to a german friend december one nine four three famous works novels the stranger l tranger also translated as the outsider one nine four two the plague la peste one nine

medical workers finding solidarity in their labor as the algerian city of oran is swept by a plague it asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition the characters in the book ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives all help to show the effects the plague
has on a populace generally taken as a metaphoric treatment of the french resistance to nazi occupation during world war ii the plague is interpreted to mean much more camus uses extreme hardships e g pain suffering and death to represent our human world the story is told through the narrative of the main character dr rieux whose decidedly existential account of events
in the story is not only helpful in exploring the philosophy of existentialism but also in making
this a metaphor of the nature of life and suffering although his approach in the book is severe he emphasizes the ideas that we ultimately have no control irrationality of life is inevitable and he further illustrates the human reaction towards the absurd the plague represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the absurd a theory which camus himself helped to define main characters dr bernard rieux jean tarrou a man vacationing

ethics environmental ethics computer ethics corporate social responsibility or business ethics many considerations of applied ethics also come into play in human rights discussions the chief difficulty with formal applied ethics is the potential for disagreement over what constitutes the proper theory or principles to apply which is bound to result in solutions to specific problems that are
not universally acceptable to all participants for example a strict deontological approach would never permit us to deceive a patient about his condition whereas a utilitarian approach would have us consider the consequences of doing so a deontologist will often come up with a very different solution than would a utilitarian given the same facts one modern approach attempting to address this is casuistry casuistry attempts to establish a plan of action to respond to particular facts a form of case based reasoning by doing so in advance of actual investigation of the
facts it can reduce influence of interest groups by focusing on action and
not the rationale it increases the possibility of agreement between prior bodies of precedent and explicit

s family moved to germany pre nazi years adolf eichmann in one nine three two when eichmann came of age in one nine two five he returned to austria to study mechanical engineering being a poor student however he soon dropped out of college eichmann then tried to follow in his father s footsteps in business working
as a travelling salesman which brought him back to germany in one nine three zero eichmann s first contact with the nazi party was when he joined the wandervogel movement which has been described as a peasant aryan brotherhood based on anti semitic ideals there is evidence however that some of the wandervogel groups had jewish members and anti semitism
may have existed in only some parts of the movement in one nine three two eichmann returned again to austria and formally joined the austrian nazi party at the age of twenty six nazi party and the ss ss scharf hrer adolf eichmann in one nine three three
on the advice of old family friend ernst kaltenbrunner eichmann joined the austrian branch of the ss enlisting on april one one nine three two as an ss anw rter he was accepted as a full
ss member that november appointed an ss mann and assigned the ss number four five three two six for the next year eichmann was a member of the part time allgemeine ss and served in a mustering formation operating from salzburg in one nine three three when the nazis came to power
in germany eichmann returned to that country and submitted an application to join the full time ss this was accepted and in november of one nine three three eichmann was promoted to scharf hrer and
assigned to the administrative staff of the dachau concentration camp by one nine three four eichmann had chosen to make the ss a career and requested transfer into the sicherheitspolizei security police which had by that time become a very powerful and feared organization eichmann s transfer was granted in november of one nine three four as he was promoted to the rank of oberscharf hrer and assigned to the headquarters of the sicherheitsdienst sd in berlin eichmann became a model administrator in the sd and quickly became noticed by his
superiors he was promoted to hauptscharf hrer in one nine three five and in one nine three seven commissioned as an ss untersturmf hrer in one nine three seven eichmann was sent to palestine with his superior herbert hagen to assess the possibilities of massive jewish emigration from germany
to palestine they landed in haifa but could only obtain a transit visa so they went on to cairo in cairo they met feival polkes an agent
of the haganah who discussed with them the plans of the zionists and tried to enlist their assistance in facilitating jewish emigration from europe according to an answer eichmann gave at his trial he had also planned to meet arab leaders in palestine this never happened because entry to palestine was refused by the british authorities afterwards eichmann and hagen wrote a report recommending against large scale emigration to palestine for economic reasons and because it contradicted the german policy of preventing the establishment
of a jewish state there this episode is sometimes seen as an important step towards the nazi abandonment of emigration as the preferred solution to the jewish problem in one nine three eight eichmann was assigned to austria to help organize ss security forces in vienna after the anschluss of austria into germany through this effort eichmann was promoted to ss obersturmf hrer and by the end of one nine three eight adolf eichmann had been selected by
the ss leadership to form the central office for jewish emigration which was in charge of forcibly deporting and expelling jews from austria through this work eichmann became a student of
judaism finding the religion fascinating while also developing deep anti semitic values and a hatred of the jewish faith world war ii adolf eichmann in one nine four two at the start of the second world war eichmann had been promoted to ss hauptsturmf hrer and had made a name for himself with his office for jewish emigration through this work eichmann made several contacts in the zionist movement which he worked with to speed up jewish emigration from the reich eichmann returned to berlin in one nine three nine after the formation of the reich
central security office rsha in december one nine three nine he was
assigned to head rsha referat iv d four the rsha department that dealt with jewish affairs and evacuation in august one nine four zero he released his reichssicherheitshauptamt madagaskar projekt reich central security office madagascar project a plan for forced jewish deportation that never materialized he was promoted to the rank of ss sturmbannf hrer in late one nine four zero and less than a year later to obersturmbannf hrer in one nine four two reinhard heydrich invited eichmann to attend the wannsee conference where germany
s anti jewish measures were set down into an official
policy of genocide to this final solution of the jewish question eichmann was tasked as transportation administrator which put him in charge of all the trains which would carry jews to the death camps in poland for the next two years eichmann performed his duties with incredible zeal often bragging that he had personally sent over five million jews to their deaths by way of his trains eichmann
s work had been noticed and in one nine four four he was sent to hungary after germany had occupied that country in fear of a soviet invasion eichmann at once went to work deporting jews and was able to send four hundred
thousand hungarians to their deaths in the nazi gas chambers by one nine four five eichmann s world was collapsing as reich leader heinrich himmler had ordered that jewish extermination be halted and evidence of the final solution be destroyed eichmann blatantly turned against himmler and continued his work in hungary against official orders eichmann was also working to avoid being called up in the last ditch german military
effort since a year before he had been commissioned as a reserve untersturmf hrer in the waffen ss and was now being ordered to active combat duty eichmann fled hungary in one nine four five as the russians invaded and he returned to austria where he met up with his old friend ernst kaltenbrunner kaltenbrunner however refused to associate with eichmann since eichmann s duties as an extermination administrator had left him a marked man by the allies post world
war ii at the end of world war ii eichmann was captured by the us army who did not know that this man who presented himself as otto eckmann was in fact a much bigger fish early in one nine four six he escaped from us custody and hid in various parts of germany for a few years in one nine four eight he obtained a landing permit for argentina but did not seek to use it immediately at the beginning
of one nine five zero eichmann went to italy where he posed as a refugee named ricardo klement with the help of a franciscan monk who had connections with archbishop alois hudal eichmann obtained an international committee of the red cross humanitarian passport and an argentinian visa he arrived by ship in argentina on july one four one nine five zero for the next ten years he worked in several odd jobs in the buenos aires area from factory foreman to junior water engineer and
professional rabbit farmer eichmann also brought his family to argentina argentina at the time was a haven for many nazis capture adolf eichmann during his one nine six one trial in jerusalem throughout the one nine five zero s many jews and other victims of the holocaust dedicated themselves to finding eichmann and other nazi war criminals among them was nazi hunter simon wiesenthal in one nine five four wiesenthal s suspicions that eichmann was in argentina were sparked upon receiving a
postcard from an associate who had moved to buenos aires i saw that dirty pig eichmann the letter read in part he lives near buenos aires and works for a water company with this and other information collected by wiesenthal the israelis had solid leads
regarding eichmann s whereabouts isser harel the then head of mossad israeli intelligence agency later claimed in an unpublished manuscript that wiesenthal had no role whatsoever in eichmann s apprehension but in fact had endangered the entire eichmann operation and aborted the planned capture of auschwitz doctor josef mengele schachter jonathan isser harel takes on nazi hunter wiesenthal had no role in eichmann kidnapping the jerusalem post seven may one nine
nine one also instrumental in exposing eichmann s identity was lothar hermann a worker of
jewish descent who fled to argentina from germany following his incarceration in the dachau concentration camp where eichmann had served as an administrator by the one nine five zero s hermann had settled into life in buenos aires with his family daughter sylvia became acquainted with the eichmann family and romantically involved with klaus the oldest
eichmann son due to klaus s boastful remarks about his father s life as a nazi and direct responsibility for the holocaust hermann knew he had struck gold in one nine five seven after reading a
newspaper report about german war criminals of which eichmann was one soon after he sent sylvia to the eichmanns home on a fact finding mission she was met at the door by eichmann himself and after unsuccessfully asking for klaus she inquired as to whether she was speaking to his father eichmann confirmed this fact excited hermann
soon began a correspondence with fritz bauer chief prosecutor for the west german state of hesse and provided details about eichmann s person and life bauer knew
that germany served by former employees of the nazi regime would do little to serve justice to eichmann he contacted israeli officials who worked closely with hermann over the next several years to learn about eichmann and to formulate a plan to capture him in one nine six zero the mossad discovered that eichmann was in argentina and began
an effort to locate his exact whereabouts when through relentless surveillance it was confirmed that ricardo klement was in fact adolf
eichmann the israeli government then approved an operation to capture eichmann and bring him to jerusalem for trial as a war criminal he was captured by a team of mossad agents on may one one one nine six zero as part of a covert operation he was flown aboard an el al airliner from argentina
to israel on may two one one nine six zero for some time the israeli government denied involvement in eichmann s capture claiming that he had been taken by jewish volunteers eventually however the pretense was dropped and then prime minister david ben gurion announced eichmann s capture to the knesset israel s national legislature on may two three one nine six zero receiving a standing ovation in return isser harel head of the mossad at the time of the operation wrote a book about eichmann s capture entitled
the house on garibaldi street some years later a member of the capture team peter malkin authored eichmann in my hands a book that contains fascinating insights into eichmann s character
and motivations but whose veracity has been attacked trial eichmann and a bulletproof glass booth during the open trial eichmann s trial in front of an israeli court in jerusalem started on april one one one nine six one he was
indicted on one five criminal charges including charges of crimes against humanity crimes against the jewish people and membership of an outlawed organization as in israeli criminal procedure his trial was presided over by three judges gideon hausner the israeli attorney general personally
acted as chief prosecutor the trial caused huge international controversy as well as an international sensation the israeli government allowed news programs all over the world to broadcast the trial live with few restrictions television viewers saw a nondescript man sitting in a
bulletproof glass booth while witnesses including many holocaust survivors testified against him and his role in transporting victims to the extermination camps during the whole trial eichmann insisted that he was only following orders the same defense used by the nazi war criminals during the one nine four five one nine four six nuremberg trials he explicitly declared that he had abdicated his consciousness in order to follow the f hrerprinzip this defense in turn promoted the milgram experiment after one four weeks of testimony
with more than one five zero zero documents one zero zero prosecution witnesses nine zero of whom were nazi concentration camp survivors and dozens of defense depositions delivered by diplomatic couriers from one six different countries the eichmann trial ended on august one four one nine six one where the judges were then left to deliberate on december one one the three judges announced their verdict where eichmann was convicted on all counts he was then sentenced to death on december one five one nine six one eichmann
appealed the verdict mostly relying on legal arguments about israel s jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which he was charged he also claimed that he was protected by the principle of acts of state and repeated his superior orders defence on may two nine one nine six two israel s supreme court sitting as a court of criminal appeal rejected the appeal and upheld the district court s judgment on all counts on may three one israeli president itzhak ben zvi turned down eichmann
s petition for mercy eichmann was hanged a few minutes after midnight on june one one nine six two at ramla prison officially the only civil
execution ever carried out in israel eichmann allegedly refused a last meal preferring instead a bottle of carmel a dry red israeli wine of which he consumed about half of the bottle he also refused to don the traditional black hood for his execution his last words were
reportedly long live germany long live austria long live argentina these
are the countries with which i have been most closely associated and i shall not forget them i had to obey the rules of war and my flag i am ready his body was cremated and ashes scattered at sea the very next morning so that no nation would serve as adolf eichmann s final resting place eichmann analysis in the four zero years since eichmann s death historians have speculated on certain facts regarding his life the most important question is how responsible eichmann was for the
implementation of the holocaust most agree that eichmann knew exactly what he was doing however some eichmann defenders his son included state that he was unfairly judged and that he
was only doing his duty as a german soldier a third and highly controversial analysis came from political theorist hannah arendt a jew who fled germany before hitler s rise and who reported on eichmann s trial for the new yorker magazine in eichmann in jerusalem a book formed by this reporting arendt concluded that aside from a desire for improving his career eichmann showed no trace of anti semitism or psychological damage she called him the embodiment of the banality of evil as he appeared at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality displaying neither guilt nor
hatred she suggested that this most strikingly discredits the idea that the nazi criminals were manifestly psychopathic and different from ordinary people many concluded from this and similar observations that even the most ordinary of people can commit horrendous crimes if placed in the right situation and given the
correct incentives but arendt disagreed with this interpretation eichmann s involvement with the ss underground group odessa is also a mystery as there is evidence that eichmann had contact with the group but did not actively participate in odessa activities rumours also abound as to whether or not eichmann personally knew josef mengele and whether or not the two war criminals ever worked together in south
america mossad was convinced that eichmann was a contact for mengele and had planned to conduct a dual capture operation in one nine six one had eichmann revealed mengele s whereabouts a footnote to eichmann s ss career focuses on the point as to why he was never promoted to the rank of full ss colonel known as standartenf hrer with eichmann s record and responsibilities he would have been
a prime candidate for advancement yet after one nine four one his ss record contains no evidence that he was ever even recommended for another promotion many have speculated that ernst kaltenbrunner may have seen eichmann as a dangerous man rising through the ss ranks and had curbed his ss career to prevent eichmann from becoming too

and three in computers the mathematical function used to perform this calculation is usually given the name abs generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings for example an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers the quaternions ordered rings fields and vector spaces the absolute value is closely related to
the notions of magnitude distance and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts the graph of the absolute value function for real numbers real numbers for any real number a the absolute value or modulus of a is denoted two a and is defined as a begin a distance below the following proposition gives an identity which is sometimes used as an alternative and equivalent definition of the absolute value proposition one a sqrt the
absolute value has the following four fundamental properties proposition two other important properties of the absolute value include proposition three b ne zero preservation of division equivalent to multiplicativeness a b ge a b equivalent to subadditivity two other useful inequalities are a le b iff b le a le b a ge b iff a le b mbox b le a the above are often used in solving inequalities for example complex numbers since the complex numbers are not ordered the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number however the
identity given in proposition one a sqrt can be seen as motivating the following definition for any complex number z x iy the absolute value or modulus of z is denoted z and is defined as z sqrt it follows that the absolute value of a real number x is
equal to its absolute value considered as a complex number since x i zero sqrt sqrt x similar to the geometric interpretation of the absolute value for real numbers it follows from the pythagorean theorem that the absolute value of a complex number is the distance in
the complex plane of that complex number from the origin and more generally that the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers the complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in propositions two and three above in addition if z x mathrmy r cos phi mathrm sin phi and
bar x iy is the complex conjugate of z then it is easily seen that z r z bar z sqrt absolute value functions the real absolute value function is continuous everywhere it is differentiable everywhere except for x zero
it is monotonically decreasing on the interval zero and monotonically increasing on the interval zero since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value it is an even function and is hence not invertible the complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere one way to see this is to show that
it does not obey the cauchy riemann equations both the real and complex functions are idempotent ordered rings the definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can easily be extended to any ordered ring that is if a is an element of an ordered ring r then the absolute value of a denoted by a is defined to be a begin a absolute value distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers agrees with the standard euclidean
distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two dimensional euclidean spaces respectively the properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers non negativity identity of indiscernibles symmetry and the triangle inequality given in propositions two and three above can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a distance function as follows a real valued function d on a set x times x is called a distance function or a metric for x if
it satisfies the following four axioms fields the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in proposition two above can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field as follows a real valued function v on a field f is called an absolute value also a modulus magnitude value or valuation if it satisfies the following four axioms it follows from the above that v one one where one denotes the multiplicative
identity element of f the real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary
field if v is an absolute value on f then the function d
on f times f defined by d a b v a b is a metric and if e is the multiplicative identity in f then the following are equivalent d satisfies the ultrametric inequality d x y le mathrm

usually a norm if it satisfies the following axioms for all a in f and mathbf mathbf in v ge zero non negativity mathbf zero iff mathbf zero positive definiteness a mathbf a mathbf positive homogeneity or positive scalability mathbf mathbf le mathbf mathbf subadditivity or triangle inequality the norm of a vector is also
called its length or magnitude in the case of euclidean space r n the function x one x two
cdots x n sqrt x i two is a norm called the euclidean norm when the real numbers r are considered as the one dimensional vector space r one the absolute value is a norm and is the p norm for any p in fact the absolute value is the only norm in r one in the sense that for every norm in r one x one x the complex absolute value is a special case of the norm

atop an underground salt bed which is basically responsible for the
arches and spires balanced rocks sandstone fins and eroded monoliths in the area thousands of
feet thick in places this salt bed was deposited over the colorado plateau some three zero zero million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated over millions of years the salt bed was covered with residue from floods and winds and the oceans that came in intervals much of this debris was compressed into rock at one time this overlying earth may have been one mile thick salt under
pressure is unstable and the salt bed below arches was no match for the weight of this thick cover of rock under such pressure it shifted buckled liquefied and repositioned itself thrusting

prospector living in salt valley ringhoffer had written to the railroad in an effort to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son in law which he called the devil s garden known today as the klondike bluffs wadleigh was impressed by what ringhoffer showed him and suggested to park service director stephen t mather that the area be made a national monument the following year additional support for
the monument idea came from laurence m gould a university of michigan graduate student studying the geology of the nearby la sal mountains who was shown the scenic area by retired local physician
dr j w doc williams landscape arch a succession of government investigators examined the area in part due to confusion as to the precise location in the process the name devil s garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of salt
valley and ringhoffer s original discovery was omitted while another area nearby known locally as the windows was included designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the park service from one nine two six but was resisted by president calvin coolidge s interior secretary finally in april one nine two nine shortly after his inauguration president herbert hoover signed a presidential proclamation
creating arches national monument consisting of two comparatively small disconnected sections the purpose of the reservation under the one nine zero six antiquities act was to protect the arches spires balanced rocks and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value the name arches was suggested by frank pinkely superintendent of the park service s southwestern national monuments following a visit to the windows section in one nine two five in late one nine three eight president franklin d roosevelt signed a proclamation which enlarged the arches to protect additional scenic

mechanical pneumatic hydraulic and other systems may also use analog signals the word analog implies an analogy between cause and effect voltage in and voltage out current in and current out sound in and frequency out an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal s information for example an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information electrically the property most commonly used is voltage followed closely by frequency current and charge any information
may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena such as sound light temperature position or
pressure and is achieved using a transducer for example in an analog sound recording the variation in pressure of a sound striking a microphone creates a corresponding variation
in the voltage amplitude of a current passing through it an increase in the volume of the sound causes the fluctuation of the current s voltage amplitude to increase while keeping the
same rhythm the primary disadvantage of analog signalling is that any system has
noise that is random variations in it as the signal is copied and re copied or transmitted over long distances these random variations become dominant electrically these losses are lessened by shielding good connections and several cable types such as coax and twisted pair the effects of noise make signal loss and
distortion impossible to recover since amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well another method of conveying an analog signal is to use modulation in this some base signal e
g a sinusoidal carrier wave has one of its properties modulated amplitude modulation involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal
voltage waveform by the source information frequency modulation changes the frequency other techniques such as changing the phase of the base signal also work analog circuits do not involve quantisation of information into digital format the concept being measured over the circuit whether sound light pressure temperature or an exceeded limit remains from end to end clocks with hands are called analog those that display digits are called digital however many analog clocks are actually digital since the hands do not move in a smooth continuous motion but in small steps every second or half a second

little niggers is a detective novel by agatha christie first published in one nine three nine plot the story focuses on ten strangers who are all but one brought by misleading information to an island off the coast of devon in southern england the characters are vera claythorne a young teacher in a third class school philip lombard a down on his luck explorer mercenary william blore a retired police inspector now a private investigator dr edward armstrong a
private physician justice lawrence wargrave a bitter cynical retired judge emily brent an elderly spinster and a religious zealot of extreme proportions rogers the butler general macarthur a lonely retired army man mrs rogers the housekeeper rogers wife anthony marston a reckless playboy on their first night the ten realize that they have been brought to the island under false pretenses but now have no means of getting away a mysterious gramophone recording informs them that all ten of them are guilty of murders
though in this case the killings cannot be dealt with by law on the first night anthony marston dies of posioning in the morning mrs rogers fails to wake up and it is determined that she probably had a fatal overdose of sleeping drugs at lunch the next day general macarthur is found dead by a blow to the back of his head after searching the island for the murderer or possible hiding spots the survivors realize that the murderer can only be one of them and
whoever it is is playing a game killing them in manners
poetically similar to a nursery rhyme and also removing one of ten little figurines in the dining room after each death the survivors have a meeting and discover that none of them have an alibi for any of the deaths the next morning rogers is found dead in the woodshed having been killed with a giant axe that was nearby later that day emily brent dies from an injection of potassium cyanide the five remaining dr armstrong justice wargrave philip lombard vera claythorne and inspector blore become increasingly paranoid later
justice wargrave is found dead having been shot through the head that night dr armostrong leaves the house and when the rest of the survivors search for him they cannot find him vera inspector blore and philip lombard go
outside blore decides to go back to the house to get some sustinance and a dull thud is heard when vera and philip check to see what happened they find blore crushed to death by a heavy marble clock they assume doctor armstrong did it and decide to stay out of the house the two survivors get back to the beach only
to find armstrong s body washed up on the shore vera and lombard they realise that they are the only two left even though they could not possibly have mudered the inspector the never ending suspicion has driven them to a breaking point and they assume each other as the murderers philip lombard reaches for he revolver only to discover that vera claythorne pickpoketed it she shoots him and then returns to the house thinking she is finally safe when vera
gets to her room she discovers a noose hanging there and having been finally driven crazy by the entire experience she
hangs herself thus fullfilling the rhyme upon which the murders were based so
by the novel s end all ten guests are dead leaving a locked room mystery a police investigation though thorough cannot find any satisfactory explanation it is resolved when a letter in a bottle tossed into the ocean and recovered by a trawler is delivered to the police which was written by the murderer film and theater christie had been disappointed in previous adaptations of her novels as she had written a play before she
decided to adapt her own book herself she decided that the staging of a play required the survival of two characters in order to carry the plot exposition consequently the resolution of the play is very different from that of the

lives in the little village of st mary mead she looks like an ordinary spinster in tweed and with a curiosity as wide as the world but when it comes to solving mysteries she turns out to have a sharp logical mind in the best detective story tradition she often embarrasses the local professional police usually by making an analogy with some village occurrence or character personality when we
first meet jane marple she is very much the stereotypical spinster of the last century blue eyed and frail wearing a black lace cap and mittens and constantly knitting she is also a gleeful gossip and not especially nice the first marple novel the murder at the vicarage sees a markedly different marple to the one who
would appear in later books as she modernized and became nicer over the years miss marple s nephew the well known author raymond west and his wife joan who first appeared as joyce a modern artist were introduced in one nine three three in the thirteen problems raymond in particular is overconfident of himself and dismissive of miss marple s

the word aaron see aaron disambiguation aaron a word meaning bearer of martyrs in hebrew perhaps also or instead related to the egyptian aha rw warrior lion standard hebrew aharon tiberian hebrew ah r n was one of two brothers who play a unique part in the history of the hebrew people he
was the elder son of amram and jochebed of the tribe of levi moses the other son being three years younger and miriam their sister several years older exodus two four exodus six one six ff numbers three three three nine aaron was the great grandson of levi exodus six one six two zero and represented the priestly functions of his tribe while moses was receiving his education at the egyptian court and during his exile among the midianites aaron and his sister remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border land of egypt here he gained a name for
eloquent and persuasive speech so that when the time came for the demand upon pharaoh to release israel from captivity aaron became his brother s nabi or spokesman to his own people exodus four one six and after their unwillingness to hear to pharaoh himself exodus seven nine his function aaron s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the court on behalf of moses who was always the central moving figure
the part played by aaron in the events that preceded the exodus was therefore ministerial and not directive he along with moses performed signs before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers exodus four one five one six at the command of moses he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues exodus seven one nine eight one one two in the infliction of the remaining plagues he
appears to have acted merely as the attendant of moses whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon pharaoh and his subjects exodus nine two
three one zero one three two two the potency of aaron s rod had already been demonstrated by
its victory over the rods of the egyptian magicians which it swallowed after all the rods alike had been turned into serpents exodus seven nine et seq during the journey in the wilderness aaron is not always prominent or active and he sometimes appears guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct at
the battle with amalek he is chosen with hur to support the hand of moses that held the
rod of god exodus one seven nine et seq when the revelation was given to moses at sinai he headed the elders of israel who accompanied moses on the way to the summit joshua however was admitted with his leader to the very presence of the lord while aaron and hur remained below to look after the people exodus two four nine one four it was during the prolonged absence of moses
that aaron yielded to the clamors of the people and made a golden calf as a visible image of the divinity
who had delivered them from egypt exodus three two one six at the intercession of moses aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people deuteronomy nine two zero exodus three two three five although it was to aaron s tribe of levi that the work of punitive vengeance was committed exodus three two two six et seq becomes priest of israel at the time when the tribe of levi was set apart for the priestly service aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood arrayed in the robes of his office and instructed in
its manifold duties exodus two eight and two nine on the very day of his consecration his sons nadav and avihu were
consumed by fire from the lord for having offered incense in an unlawful manner leviticus one zero rebellion of korah from the time of the sojourn at sinai where he became the anointed priest of israel aaron ceased to be the minister of moses his place being taken by joshua he is mentioned in association with miriam in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of moses as the lord s prophet the presumption of the murmurers was rebuked and miriam was
smitten with tzara as aaron entreated moses to intercede for her at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity and miriam after seven days quarantine was healed and restored to favor numbers one two it is noteworthy that the prophet micah six four mentions moses aaron and miriam as the leaders of israel after the exodus a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives in the present instance it is made clear by the express
words of the oracle numbers one two six eight that moses was unique among men as the one with
whom the lord spoke face to face the failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of miriam and aaron the validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of aaron was attested after the ill fated rebellion of korah who was
a first cousin of aaron when the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents numbers one six two five three five eleazar the son of aaron was commissioned to take
charge of the censers of the dead priests and when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels aaron at the command of moses took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed numbers one seven one one five one six three six five zero authorized version another memorable transaction followed each of the tribal princes of israel took
a rod and wrote his name upon it and the twelve rods were laid up over night in the tent of meeting on the morrow aaron s rod was found to have budded and blossomed and borne
ripe almonds numbers one seven eight see aaron s rod the miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of levi but now a formal distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of aaron and the other levites while all the levites and only levites were to be devoted to sacred services the special charge of the sanctuary and the altar was committed to the aaronites alone numbers one eight one seven
the scene of this enactment is unknown nor is the time mentioned death aaron like moses was not permitted to enter canaan with the successful invaders the reason alleged is that the two brothers showed impatience at meribah kadesh in the last year of the desert pilgrimage numbers two zero one two one three when they or rather moses brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people the action was construed as displaying a want of deference to the lord since they had been commanded to speak to
the rock whereas moses struck it with the wonder working rod numbers two zero seven one one of the death of aaron we have two accounts the principal one gives a detailed statement to the effect that
soon after the above incident aaron with his son eleazar and moses ascended mount hor there moses stripped him aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to eleazar aaron died on the summit of the mountain and the people mourned for him thirty days numbers two zero two two two nine compare
three three three eight three nine the other account is found in deuteronomy one zero six where moses is
reported as saying that aaron died at mosera and was buried there some scholars think that mosera is not on mount hor since the itinerary in numbers three three three one three seven records seven stages between moseroth mosera
and mount hor typical signification in apocryphal and rabbinical literature the older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth men without the spirit of god and lacking the will power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities thus aaron the typical priest ranks far below moses he is but his mouthpiece and the executor of the
will of god revealed through moses although it is pointed out sifra wa yi ra one that it is said fifteen times in the pentateuch that the lord spoke to moses and aaron under the influence of the priesthood which shaped the destinies of the nation under persian rule a different
ideal of the priest was formed as is learned from malachi two four seven and the prevailing tendency was to place aaron on a footing equal with moses at times aaron and at other times moses is mentioned first in scripture this is to show that they were of equal rank says mekilta one and ecclesiasticus sirach four four six two four expressly infers this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of aaron s ministration moses and aaron compared according to tan uma ed buber two one two aaron s activity as a prophet began
earlier than that of moses the writer of the testaments of the patriarchs however hesitates to rank moses the faithful him that speaks with god as with a father as equal with aaron testament of levi eight one seven the rabbis are still more emphatic in their praise of aaron s virtues thus hillel who in herod s time saw before him mainly a degenerate class of priests selfish and quarrelsome
held aaron of old up as a mirror saying be of the disciples of aaron loving peace and pursuing peace love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the law abot one one two this is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in abot de rabbi natan one two sanhedrin six b and
elsewhere according to which aaron was an ideal priest of the people far more beloved for his kindly ways than was moses while moses was stern and uncompromising brooking no wrong aaron went about as peacemaker reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged
or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled and winning evil doers back into the right way by his
friendly intercourse the mourning of the people at aaron s death was greater therefore than at that of moses for whereas when aaron died the whole house of israel wept including the women numbers two zero two nine moses was bewailed by the sons of israel only deuteronomy three four eight even in the making of the golden calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for aaron sanhedrin seven a his fortitude and silent submission to the will of god on the loss of his two
sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify god in the midst of great affliction zeba im one one five b josephus antiquities of the jews three eight seven especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by god after the princes of the twelve tribes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared tabernacle say to thy brother aaron greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift for thou art
called upon to kindle the light and while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the temple lasts thy light of the law shall last forever tan uma ed buber six death of aaron in fulfillment of the promise of peaceful life symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head leviticus rabbah one zero midrash tehilim one three three one aaron s death as described in the haggadah was of a wonderful tranquillity accompanied by moses his brother and by eleazar his son aaron went to the summit of mount hor
where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son eleazar said moses and then follow me aaron did as commanded and they entered the cave where was prepared a bed around which angels stood go lie down upon thy bed my brother moses continued and aaron obeyed without a murmur then his soul
departed as if by a kiss from god the cave closed behind moses as he left and he went down the hill with eleazar with garments rent and crying alas aaron my brother thou the pillar of supplication of israel when the israelites cried in bewilderment where is aaron angels were seen carrying aaron s bier through the air a voice was then heard saying the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not
found on his lips he walked with me in righteousness and brought many back from sin malachi two six seven he died according to seder olam r nine rosh ha shanah two three a and josephus antiquities of the jews four four seven on the first
of ab josephus says also that he died while the multitude looked upon him the pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of israel s camp disappeared at aaron s death see seder olam nine and rosh ha shanah two b three a the seeming contradiction between numbers two zero two two et seq and deuteronomy one zero six is solved by the rabbis in the following manner aaron s death on mount hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king
of arad in consequence of which the israelites fled marching seven stations backward to mosera where they performed the rites of mourning for aaron wherefore it is said there at mosera died aaron see mekilta beshalla wayassa one tan uma hu at one eight yerushalmi so ah one one seven c and targum yerushalmi numbers and deuteronomy on the above mentioned passages the rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united aaron and moses when
the latter was appointed ruler and aaron high priest neither betrayed any jealousy instead they rejoiced in one another s greatness when moses at first declined to go to pharaoh
saying o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send exodus four one three he was unwilling
to deprive aaron his brother of the high position the latter had held for so many years
but the lord reassured him saying behold when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart exodus four one four indeed aaron was to find his reward says simon ben yo ai for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother s rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the urim and thummim which were
to be upon aaron s heart when he goeth in before the lord canticles rabbah one one zero moses and aaron met in gladness of heart kissing each other as true brothers exodus four two seven compare song of songs eight one
and of them it is written behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity psalms one three three one of them it is said psalms eight five one zero mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other for moses stood for righteousness according to deuteronomy three three two one and aaron for peace according to malachi two six
again mercy was personified in aaron according to deuteronomy three three eight and truth in moses according to numbers one two seven tan uma shemot ed buber two four two six when moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of aaron aaron modestly shrank back and said who knows whether i have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office then the holy spirit spake the words behold
the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon
the beard of aaron that even went down to the skirts of his garment is as pure as the dew of hermon psalms one three three two three heb sifra shemini milluim tan uma korah ed buber one four genetics recently the tradition that kohanim are
actually descended from aaron was supported by genetic testing skorecki et al one nine nine seven since all direct male lineage shares a common y chromosome testing was done across sectors of the jewish population to see if there was any commonality between their y chromosomes there was proven to be certain distinctions among the cohen modal haplotype implying that the kohanim do share some common ancestry this information was used to support the claim of the lemba a sub saharan tribe that they were in fact
a tribe of jews according to the documentary hypothesis the biblical representation of his character negative and shadowy compared with moses s may be viewed in several ways a clue to
the seemingly contradictory delineations of aaron other than the obvious explanation that he is a complex character is found in the framework of
documentary analysis see also hexateuch which is accepted by some but not all scholars according to those who accept the documentary hypothesis the following portions of text belong to one e two j three d and four p sources respectively with the fifth item being from ezekiel aaron as fallible these passages do not represent aaron as a sacrosanct priest he comes to meet moses exodus four one four supports him in war exodus one seven one two and jurisprudence exodus two four one four he yields to the people and makes the calf exodus three two and with miriam
criticises moses for marrying a cushite woman miriam is subsequently punished numbers one two he is present at the sacrificial covenant meal between israel and the kenites exodus one eight one two in this aspect joshua instead of aaron serves in the tent exodus three three one one aaron as moses s prophet this representation concerns the covenant meal on sinai exodus two four one two nine one one and the vague charge that aaron let the people loose exodus three two two five aaron seems
to be an afterthought in the plague narrative exodus eight two five in both this and the last view moses is the viceregent of god and aaron is moses prophet exodus four one six seven one aaron as idolatrous in deuteronomy nine aaron is partly responsible for the building of the golden calf the story says that yahweh is so angry toward aaron that he was about to destroy him it appears that it is only moses s intercessory prayer and his destruction of the golden calf which saves aaron the account
of his death in deuteromy one zero six is different from that in numbers two zero two two according to deuteronomy it occurred at moserah seven stations from mount
hor numbers three three three zero in the early months of the wandering because of the sign of the golden calf the only other passage in reference to aaron in deuteronomy merely states that he is the brother of
moses deuteronomy three two five zero aaron as subordinate the first three simpler plagues aaron brings on at moses command thereafter moses himself is the actor in the narratives numbers one six one seven it is moses in each case who vindicates him aaron dies at mount hor in the fortieth year of the exodus numbers two zero two two three three three eight because of rebellion at meribah cf deuteronomy as above aaron as non

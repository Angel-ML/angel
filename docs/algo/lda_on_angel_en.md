# LDA（Latent Dirichlet Allocation）

---

> LDA is a widely-used topic-modeling technique, a Bayesian generative model for discovering hidden topical patterns that helps in dimension reduction and text analysis.

## 1. Introduction

### Overview

A text corpus ``$ C $`` contains a set of documents `` $ \{D_1, \cdots, D_{M}\} $``, and each document ``$ D_i $`` contains a set of words, ``$ D_i = (t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_{N_i}) $``. A word is a basic unit of a vocabulary denoted by ``$ V $``. The number of topics in LDA, ``$ K $``,  needs to be specified. In LDA, each document is modeled as a random mixture over ``$ K $`` latent topics, ``$ \theta_d $``, whereas each topic is modeled as a ``$ V $`` dimensional distribution over words, ``$ \phi_k $``.

LDA models the generative process for each document in the corpus. It draws a ``$ K $`` dimensional topic distribution, ``$ \theta_d $``, from a Dirichlet distribution, ``$ Dir(\alpha) $``, where ``$ \alpha $`` is the parameter vector of the Dirichlet (hyperparameter of the LDA). To generate each word ``$ t_{dn} $`` in document ``$ d $``, LDA first draws the topic of the word, ``$ z_{dn} $``, from a multinomial distribution ``$ Mult(\theta_d) $``, and then draws the word ``$ w_{dn} \in V $`` from a multinomial distribution ``$ Mult(\phi_{z_{dn}}) $``.

### Gibbs Sampling
A common inference technique for LDA is Gibbs Sampling, which is a MCMC method for sampling from the posterior distribution of ``$ z_{dn} $`` and infer the distribution over topics and the distribution over words for each document. Some commonly used Gibbs Sampling variants include the Collapsed Gibbs Sampling(CGS), SparseLDA, 
AliasLDA, F+LDA, LightLDA and WarpLDA, to name a few, and our experiment results suggest F+LDA as most suitable for training LDA on Angel. 

### Collapsed Gibbs Sampling (CGS)
We use ``$ Z=\{z_d\}_{d=1}^D $`` to represent the set of topics for all words, ``$ \Phi = [\phi_1 \cdots \phi_{V}] $`` to represent the ``$ V \times K $`` topic-word matrix, and ``$ \Theta = [\theta_1 \cdots \theta_D] $`` to represent the matrix whose columns are the topic distributions for all documents, then, training LDA requires inferring the posterior of the latent variable ``$ (\Theta, \Phi, Z) $``, given the observed variable ``$ Z $`` and the hyperparameters. Using conjugate prior, CGS gives a closed-form expression for the posterior of ``$ Z $``, resulting in simple iterations for sampling ``$ z_{dn} $`` following the conditional probability below:

```math
p(z_{dn} = k| t_{dn} = w, Z_{\neg dn}, C_{\neg dn}) \propto \\
			\frac{C_{wk}^{\neg dn} + \beta}{C_{k}^{\neg dn} \\
			+ V\beta}~(C_{dk}^{\neg dn}  + \alpha)
```

### F+LDA
F+LDA factorizes the probability into two parts, ``$ C_{dk} \frac{C_{wk} + \beta}{C_k + V\beta} $`` and ``$ \alpha \frac{C_{wk} + \beta}{C_k + V\beta} $``. Because ``$ C_d $`` is sparse, sampling will be only done for its non-zero elements; for the rest, F+LDA uses the F+ tree for searching, thus reducing the complexity to O(logK). Overall, F+LDA's complexity is ``$ O(K_d) $``, where ``$ K_d $`` is the number of non-zero elements in the document-topic matrix.

## 2. Distributed Implementation on Angel

The overall framework for training LDA on Angel is shown in the figure below. There are two comparatively large matrices in LDA, ``$ C_w $`` and ``$ C_d $``, and we slice C_d to different workers, and C_w to different servers. In each iteration, workers pull C_w from the servers for drawing topics, and send the updates on C_w back to the servers.

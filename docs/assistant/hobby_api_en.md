# Auxiliary Classes

---

We make continuing effort to provide sufficient auxiliary support for the ease of development of Angel. Currently, two auxiliary classes are available:

* [GlobelMetrics](./GlobalMetrics_en.md)
* [ModelConverter](./ModelConverter_en.md)

Understanding these auxiliary classes and modules is helpful for easy debugging and efficient development.

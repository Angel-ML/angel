/**
  * Coalesce the partitions of a parent RDD (`prev`) into fewer partitions, so that each partition of
  * this RDD computes one or more of the parent ones. It will produce exactly `maxPartitions` if the
  * parent had more than maxPartitions, or fewer if the parent had fewer.
  *
  * This transformation is useful when an RDD with many partitions gets filtered into a smaller one,
  * or to avoid having a large number of small tasks when processing a directory with many files.
  *
  * If there is no locality information (no preferredLocations) in the parent, then the coalescing
  * is very simple: chunk parents that are close in the Array in chunks.
  * If there is locality information, it proceeds to pack them with the following four goals:
  *
  * (1) Balance the groups so they roughly have the same number of parent partitions
  * (2) Achieve locality per partition, i.e. find one machine which most parent partitions prefer
  * (3) Be efficient, i.e. O(n) algorithm for n parent partitions (problem is likely NP-hard)
  * (4) Balance preferred machines, i.e. avoid as much as possible picking the same preferred machine
  *
  * Furthermore, it is assumed that the parent RDD may have many partitions, e.g. 100 000.
  * We assume the final number of desired partitions is small, e.g. less than 1000.
  *
  * The algorithm tries to assign unique preferred machines to each partition. If the number of
  * desired partitions is greater than the number of preferred machines (can happen), it needs to
  * start picking duplicate preferred machines. This is determined using coupon collector estimation
  * (2n log(n)). The load balancing is done using power-of-two randomized bins-balls with one twist:
  * it tries to also achieve locality. This is done by allowing a slack (balanceSlack) between two
  * bins. If two bins are within the slack in terms of balance, the algorithm will assign partitions
  * according to locality. (contact alig for questions)

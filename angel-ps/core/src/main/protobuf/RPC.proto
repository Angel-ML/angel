/**
 * Specification of (unsecure) ml RPC:
 *
 * Client needs to set up a connection first to a server serving a certain
 * Wasp protocol (like ClientProtocol). Once the connection is set up, the 
 * client and server communicates on that channel for RPC requests/responses.
 * The sections below describe the flow. 
 * 
 * As part of setting up a connection to a server, the client needs to send
 * the ConnectionHeader header. At the data level, this looks like
 * <"hrpc"-bytearray><'5'[byte]><length-of-serialized-ConnectionHeader-obj[int32]><ConnectionHeader-object serialized>
 *
 * For every RPC that the client makes it needs to send the following
 * RpcRequestHeader and the RpcRequestBody. At the data level this looks like:
 *  <length-of-serialized-RpcRequestHeader + length-of-varint32-of-serialized-RpcRequestHeader + 
 *   length-of-serialized-RpcRequestBody + length-of-varint32-of-serialized-RpcRequestBody>
 *  <RpcRequestHeader [serialized using Message.writeDelimitedTo]>
 *  <RpcRequestBody [serialized using Message.writeDelimitedTo]>
 *
 * On a success, the server's protobuf response looks like
 *  <RpcResponseHeader-object [serialized using Message.writeDelimitedTo]>
 *  <RpcResponseBody-object [serialized using Message.writeDelimitedTo]>
 * On a failure, the server's protobuf response looks like
 *  <RpcResponseHeader-object [serialized using Message.writeDelimitedTo]>
 *  <RpcException-object [serialized using Message.writeDelimitedTo]>
 *
 * There is one special message that's sent from client to server -
 * the Ping message. At the data level, this is just the bytes corresponding
 *   to integer -1.
